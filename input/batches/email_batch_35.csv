economic thought raise issue whether modify goals u monetary policy indeed number countries notably adopted euro common curency start year accepted price stability new primary goal monetary policies  letter spell evolution legislation governing u monetary policy goals summarize debate whether could improved  evolution fed legislative mandate  federal reserve act incorporate macroeconomic goals monetary policy instead required fed provide elastic currency meant fed help economy avoid financial panics bank runs plagued th century serving lender last resort involved making loans directly depository institutions discount windows reserve banks early period actions monetary policy affected macro economy determined u government adherence gold standard  trauma great depression coupled insights keynes led acknowledgment obligation federal government prevent recessions employment act first legislative statement macroeconomic policy goals although specifically mention federal reserve required federal government general foster conditions afforded useful employment opportunities able willing seeking work promote maximum employment production purchasing power  great inflation next major u economic dislocation problem addressed amendment federal reserve act provided first explicit recognition price stability national policy goal amended act states fed shall maintain long run growth monetary credit aggregates commensurate economy long run potential increase production promote effectively goals maximum employment stable prices moderate long term interest rates goals stable prices moderate long term interest rates related nominal interest rates boosted premium real rates equal expected future inflation thus stable prices typically produce long term interest rates moderate  objective maximum employment remained intact employment act however interpretation term may changed intervening years immediately world war ii conscription price controls produced high pressure economy low unemployment u perhaps believed goal maximum employment could taken mathematical sense mean highest possible level employment however second half well understood frictional unemployment involves search new jobs transition occupations  necessary accompaniment proper functioning economy long run  understanding went hand hand latter half general acceptance natural rate hypothesis implies policy try keep employment long run trend permanently equivalently unemployment rate natural rate inflation would pushed higher higher policy temporarily reduce unemployment rate natural rate equivalently boost employment long run trend however persistently attempting maintain maximum employment long run level would consistent goal stable prices  thus order maximum employment stable prices mutually consistent goals maximum employment interpreted meaning maximum sustainable employment referred also full employment moreover although fed little influence long run level employment attempt smooth short run fluctuations accordingly promoting full employment interpreted countercyclical monetary policy fed aims smooth amplitude business cycle  interpretation fed mandate later confirmed humphrey hawkins legislation official title full employment balanced growth act clearly implies legislation mandates federal government generally promote full employment production increased real income balanced growth balanced federal budget adequate productivity growth proper attention national priorities achievement improved trade balance reasonable price stability italics added  besides clarifying general goal full employment humphrey hawkins act also specified numerical definitions targets act specified two initial goals unemployment rate full employment cpi inflation rate price stability interim goals achieved followed reduction inflation  however disinflation policies period impede achievement full employment goal thereafter timetable achieve maintain price stability full employment defined year economic report president  debate fed current mandate  fed two main legislated goals monetary policy promoting full employment promoting stable prices mandate fed helped foster exceptional performance u economy past decade still argued fed mandate could improved especially looking ahead future attempts maintain institutionalize recent low inflation much discussion centered two topics transparency goals dual nature  transparency goals refers extent objectives monetary policy clearly defined easily obviously understood public goal full employment never transparent directly observed estimated economists limited precision example economic report president authority matter humphrey hawkins act gives range unemployment rate consistent full employment midpoint research suggests wide range uncertainty around estimate natural rate one prominent study finding probability falls wide range see walsh  price stability goal also subject ambiguity recent economic analysis uncovered systematic biases say order percentage point cpi measurement inflation see motley case actual price stability would consistent measured inflation addition point time different price indexes register different rates inflation past year example cpi risen gdp price index risen still transparent price stability goal could specified precise numerical growth rate range particular index could take account biases however economists also suggested ways enhance transparency policy example publishing medium term inflation forecasts might help clarify direction policy rudebusch walsh central bank control inflation medium term forecasts would contain indication wanted inflation go  second recent proposed modification fed goals involves focusing  larger extent price stability de emphasizing business cycle stabilization economists argued dual goals lead inflation bias despite fed best attempts control inflation argument stresses temptation engineer gains output  short run overcome central bank desire control inflation  long run result elevated inflation expectations public inflation end higher central bank intended despite best efforts time inconsistency argument economists call coupled pain incurred inflation skyrocketed early inflation reduced moderate levels persuaded many primary goal central bank stabilize prices  view embodied charter central bank new european monetary union primary objective european system central banks maintain price stability without prejudice objective price stability escb shall support general economic policies community among latter policies high level employment balanced development economic activities  economists remain divided importance time inconsistency problem need put primary emphasis price stability expense output stabilization stress fact central bank entity guarantee price stability goal likely attained long unless price stability designated primary goal others find arguments time inconsistency implausible policymakers aware arguments inflationary bias see implications inflation conduct policy without inflationary bias mccallum still others argue abdication goals irresponsible fuhrer also good deal empirical research using simulations models u economy suggests focus dual goals reduce variance real gdp e smooth business cycle achieving inflation goal well rudebusch svensson
