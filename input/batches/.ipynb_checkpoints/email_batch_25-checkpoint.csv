jeff at the risk of sounding too much like nancy i think it would be nice if we could try to play music again i picked up the damn mandolin so that i could actually play not just practice in my room all alone i know that there are many issues that arise between all of us but maybe we can talk about them individually and together and then try to simply be more mellow have more fun that doesn t mean that we can t practice however everything must be done in the spirit of enjoyment all this is pretty obvious to all of us and i don t need any of you to address this issue in e mail but we ve had a lot of good times playing together and i would like us to rise above this and move ahead and perhaps get to a better place after all summer is on the way and we want to be able to impress our

water turn ed generator at his mill in and sold it between dusk and midnight to anybody in alton kan who knew what to do with it soon he quit the millin g business and started stringing transmission lines across the western part o f the state before his death in he had built a utility that lit kans as communities kansas city s utilicorp united is perhaps the only fourth generation family controlled electric utility in the country today the outfit once  called missouri public service is headed by lemuel green s two great grandsons richard green took over as chief executive in three years after  his father s death at the time missouri public service served customers in two states and had million in revenues richard s brother  robert now joined him three years later standing pat was not an option deregulation was in the air and the rules  were changing the brothers remade the company they spent billion buyin g utilities in other parts of the u s canada australia and new zealand utilicorp now serves million customers in seven states and four countries  more important they veered off into other parts of the energy business in  they acquired gas properties from peoples natural gas of omaha and got a two person gas trading operation as part of the deal that little trading  operation now a subsidiary called aquila turned into something almost as  valuable as all the rest of the company with its megawatts of power  generated in some power plants around the country my brother and i received strong advice that we would never be able to be  competitive in this business says bob green oh yeah aquila has  employees and competes with the likes of duke dynegy and enron according to natural gas week aquila was the fourth largest power and gas marketer in t he country last year aquila trades a host of other products as well everythin g from weather condition hedges to bandwidth problem trading operations require capital just as power plants do the solution until now has been what brother bob calls our asset lite strategy we want to control the capacity not own it so aquila may provi de the gas to power a so called merchant plant one that produces electricity to sell in the market in return for a claim on its production but so far aquila has not been a big player in the most profitable parts of the business taking on big risk in larger transactions the way enron and dyneg y do what to do in mid december utilicorp announced that it would offer o f aquila to the public raising capital while creating a market value for its  trading operation just as competitors constellation energy and southern company are doing the hope is that the new entity will garner a multiple o f to times earnings then if all were to go as planned utilicorp woul d spin off the rest of the operation in a tax free distribution the timing looks good aquila has no material exposure in the california market furthermore the volatility in that market has been a bonanza for  many firms that trade power including aquila its trading subsidiary is th e reason utilicorp s earnings were up last year to million on  billion in sales utilicorp s shares doubled in the past year to but will the california crisis nonetheless poison the market for an aquila  stock offering it might and utilicorp cannot afford to hold its breath in  the capital markets forever even with its asset lite strategy the compa ny is far more leveraged than most utilities with debt at of capital versus the norm for electric utilities the offering is supposed to rai se million or so that could be used to pay down a bit of the parent s  billion in debt if bob green is walking a financial tightrope you could never tell it by  talking to him we see this company as our heritage he says confidently  this despite the fact that after seven equity offerings the family s share of utilicorp is now down from when richard took over might the greens lose their heirloom in a takeover battle they might but  they might come out ahead anyway look at the family history lemuel sold  some of his utility assets for million in and diversified into california orange groves the assets were resold to samuel insull the midwestern electricity magnate who came to a bad end when his pyramid of holding companies collapsed during the depression years later after congress reacted

new forecast for meteorologists it s raining job offers energy trading firms snap up grads of an inexact science no blow dryer no proble m by chip cummins staff reporter of the wall street journal  the wall street journal a copyright c dow jones company inc two years ago bradley hoggatt was heading for an academic career in meteorology intent on discovering more about how hurricanes form but just  before he started working on a doctorate a very different opportunity blew  in now mr hoggatt forecasts weather for a floor full of m b a s who trade billions of dollars in weather sensitive energy commodities such as natural  gas and electricity for aquila inc the trading subsidiary of a big midwes t utility with no business background himself mr hoggatt is also trading complex financial contracts based on his predictions i m putting my money where m y mouth is says the tall square shouldered year old weathermen and women have become a hot commodity in the exploding energy trading business while off target forecasts on television may frustrate parents and schools and embarrass politicians as they did this  week on the east coast they can lose bundles for electricity and natural g as traders so as trading has boomed so has demand for trained meteorologists  a profession that traditionally hasn t paid all that well and is often the  butt of jokes from wall street to houston s louisiana street where many energy companies  have set up shop recent graduates are earning twice what they would earn a t the national weather service or in academia the appetite for weather is  insatiable says james l gooding director of meteorology at duke energy  corp a former nasa scientist dr gooding will be adding a fourth forecast er to his houston team in the next year enron corp an energy trading giant based in houston has more than double d its staff of weather forecasters to nine in the past three years plucking  talent from places like the weather channel williams cos a tulsa okla  competitor is endowing university fellowships to lure meteorology students  and since aquila which is owned by utilicorp united inc of kansas  city mo has hired two other meteorologists from mr hoggatt s alma mater  the university of wisconsin plus another scientist with a ph d in climatology that hiring paid off a bit during this week s winter storm in the northeast  while many on the east coast were getting miscues from tv weathermen on a  pending possibly historic blizzard that fizzled in new york and other cities traders at aquila simply looked to mr hoggatt last friday scott macrorie an electricity trader for the mid atlantic region at aquila stopped by to see how the storm was progressing mr hoggatt s team told him temperatures in his region of interest would be low er because of the storm though the snowfall forecast on tv seemed a little high sure enough temperatures fell and snowfall in many cities was less  than predicted lifting electricity prices and making mr macrorie a profit  that he says was in the tens of thousands of dollars about university students in the u s graduate each year with bachelor s degrees in meteorology according to the american meteorological society a n additional or so graduate with masters degrees or doctorates until jus t a few years ago those graduates didn t typically have many options tv for  those who had the blow dried look back office jobs with the government or a handful of private consultants for those who didn t research was an option  and some airlines and utilities kept a few meteorologists on staff to help  position airplanes or power line repair trucks during storms now deep pocketed trading companies are offering many meteorologists with  graduate degrees salaries ranging from to performance and  trading bonuses can double or even triple the figure that compares with th e roughly the national weather service pays a junior forecaster with a graduate degree it s a bit unusual for meteorologists to have the prospect of lucrative employment after graduation says john nielsen gammon a professor of atmospheric sciences at texas a m university this is a bit of a switch  so far there has been no dearth of meteorological talent available partly  because the national weather service wrapped up a big expansion project in  the mid s and slowed hiring it hires only to replace people who leave  about to meteorologists a year and the high pressure world of billion dollar commodity bets isn t for everyone when carl altoe graduated from penn state one of the nation s to p meteorology programs he got a heavy sales pitch from enron it s quite an  impressive place he says of enron s trading floor but he wasn t sure forecasting skills alone would be enough to make the grade i would be afraid that if money wasn t made in a hurry i d be tossed says mr altoe  who accepted a position with the national weather service in marquette mic h for others having forecasts count puts a new thrill in

work place he was looking for also he d be getting a to boost ove r his weather channel salary before potential bonuses from enron i m getting more money than i would anywhere else he says weather has long affected prices of everything from grain at chicago s earl y commodity markets to the stocks of retail companies on wall street jon davis a meteorologist for salomon smith barney in chicago started forecasting the weather for agriculture traders back in but volatile energy prices have raised the stakes for forecasters who are  able to gauge air conditioning use in the summer or natural gas demand duri ng the winter heating season meanwhile all sorts of companies are turning to  energy traders and wall street for weather derivatives complex contracts  used to hedge financial risks associated with the weather with every passing year you do more energy and more energy mr davis says despite big advances in data collection and modeling betting millions of  dollars on weather forecasts can still be tricky business short term forecasts are pretty good predicting weather two weeks from now is chancy  most meteorologists get their data from the government particularly the national weather service many then tweak it with their own interpretations  or forecasting models disappointed last year by poor long term forecasts from private consultants aquila has a contest offering to the meteorologist or  team that can best predict temperatures in major u s cities over the course of a year i call it the forecast bakeoff says mr hoggatt the high stakes also mean more pressure on forecasters wsi corp a billerica mass weather forecasting firm started an energy service last  year and jeffrey a shorter a wsi vice president says energy clients can  be less forgiving

greetings laura and marybeth laura if you have the time and the inclination i d like to spend a half hour briefing you on the energy situation i apologize for the brevity of this note but can fill you in more if you think that there s value in chatting in a nutshell there s a concerted effort underway one last big push to try to get a comprehensive solution in place for california that works for the majority of constituencies i e broad coalition right and left of center the deal would be bi partisan if successful the deal would put rates in place that reflect and cover costs repay debts send the right price signals for efficiency but fall short of shock therapy return the utility to creditworthiness as a result of the new rates use the minimum amount of state and utility backed bonds to finance the solution turn the procurement role back over to the utilities and away from the state once creditworthiness is established months following the rate changes establish the competitive market structure that california was promised but never got consumer choice for all customers months later large industrial would be required to procure electricity needs from the market not include government takeovers of the industry e g sale of utility transmission assets to the state would not be part of any deal include a contribution from large players e g utilities and suppliers resolve the myriad lawsuits investigations etc those involved still believe that there is a need for a group of wise persons to help get the deal done l summers is willing others are being considered your name has come up but that issue can be addressed later the goal of a phone call would be to bring you up to speed on the events which are breaking quickly hope all is well and hope to talk to you soon congratulations on haas ranking in us news and world report best jeff office pager home cell,0

bill just a short note to let you know whats going on at bakersfield i have spoken to the agency inspector about one of the nov issues and have been told that eott will definately receive a an nov and fine for failure to conduct the emissions testing on a heater that apparently should have been tested approx months ago with repsect to the other nov issue rick suderman had a testing company in to perform emissions testing on another heater which was required to be tested by today as the testing contractor began his testing an issue developed with the equipment the testing company was using and a miscommunication on the part of the testing contractor was directed to rick as a result the the inspector observed elevated co readings from the heater that rick had made adjustments in the heater set points based upon recommendations from the contractor causing the elevated co readings to result the inspector stated that the facility would receive another nov for this exceedance in any event this isssue was not rick s fault and was due to some bad communication on the part of the contractor we have sent the testing company home and will be bringing in another testing company aeros on thursday this is the contractor who has done the majority of the previous emissions testing for the facility to complete the heater testing and substantiate the innaccuracy of the first testing company s data with this new data we shold be able to demonstrate inaccuracy in the first testing company s qa qc it should also be mentioned that we have identified other environmental issues which we should discuss at your convenience butch and i will have completed the permit compliance investigataion and be available for discussions on friday william kendrick am to rich jolly et s enron edward attanasio remote eott eott cc john shafer ots enron larry campbell et s enron subject re environmental ncl rich ed larry campbell is going to bakersfield this week to address the situation i have asked him to put together a compliance calendar for the bakersfield facility outlining regulatory deadlines required by the permits and regulations he has discussed the testing due on one of the heaters this week with the regulators and there does not appear to be an issue it is my understanding that the heater will be performed this week larry will look into the best course of action necessary to address the engine testing that was apparently missed last year he will be discussing the matter with gary please call with any questions thanks bill  rich jolly pm to edward attanasio eott com cc molly sample eott com lsoldano enron com bob jacobs eott com rjolly enron com rick suderman eott com larry campbell et s enron enron william kendrick ots enron enron subject re environmental ncl ed thanks for the information bill kendricks from houston has asked larry campbell to work with rick on getting this resolved i talked with larry today and he was going to give rick a call rich edward attanasio eott com on pm to molly sample eott com lsoldano enron com cc bob jacobs eott com rjolly enron com rick suderman eott com subject environmental ncl i just spoke with gary fuller who informed me that we have been notified by the air district that we are getting an nov for missing a source test in december apparently on one of our ic engines now while this is not the end of the world we put ourselves at potential risk if we do not follow up properly especially given the history of this plant with this air district that is the koch troubles that resulted in a criminal investigation from some relatively minor problems really in fact i believe that if we act promptly and conduct the source test now we stand a very good chance of having this nov rescinded but we must act i am please to see that we still have gary on the job and i hope he can follow through with this i have asked him to do so and also to handle reporting of the soil contamination at ncl that we have all discussed at length i have done so because delay works against us on both of these issues gary though is somewhat reluctant to act without instruction directly from ets which is understandable given that ets runs things he seems to feel that he should be getting direction from cutty cunningham although i must confess i don t know enough yet about the structure of ets to know why this is the case in any event i asked gary to talk to whomever he needed to but these matters needed to be handled in the short run obviously we will discuss next week what is to be done for the long run in the meantime i would greatly appreciate whatever you folks can do to help grease the wheels to make gary feel he has authority to act to get these more immediate problems addressed thanks a bunch,0

soaring electric use more fiction than fact chronicle investigation finds power companies manipulate data to excuse their towering rates christian berthelsen scott winokur chronicle staff writers sunday march san francisco chronicle url http www sfgate com cgi bin article cgi file chronicle archive m n dtl power companies say it so often and with such certainty that it has become a virtual mantra skyrocketing energy use by californians is a root cause of the state s power crisis and justification for surging electricity prices but a computer analysis of electricity usage data by the chronicle reveals that the mantra is a myth that overall growth in electricity demand hasn t been nearly as great as the industry portrays it the industry has painted the summer of as the equivalent of a year storm in meteorology an event so powerful and unexpected that the existing infrastructure was devastated by its force the statistics show that taken in total was nothing of the sort moreover two independent state agencies assessments of california s power plant capacity appear to show that the growth should have been easily accommodated the companies have defended their practice of increasingly taking power generation plants out of service by arguing that heavy demand and consequent plant usage necessitated major time consuming repairs the claims that demand growth is rampant and that it was totally unexpected and due to the internet economy to silicon valley or server farms or people recharging cell phones that s bogus said tom kelly assistant executive director of the california energy commission about as bogus as you can get the chronicle s findings are based on data collected by the california independent system operator a manager of the state s electricity grid they show total electricity consumption in california increased only percent in from a sharp contrast to claims of industry representatives who have repeatedly relied on isolated loose or selective comparisons that make growth appear as high as percent in fact the single greatest hour of electricity usage in was actually lower than any peak demand period in or average peak demand the average of the highest hour of electricity usage for each day increased only percent from to even during the months of may to september in when the greatest spikes in electricity usage occur demand growth was only percent higher than the same period the year before more than days of critical power shortage warnings so called stage emergencies and two days of blackouts this year occurred at times of moderate energy use levels often below those at which neither warnings nor blackouts have occurred in the past the findings appear to buttress suspicions that the skyrocketing demand explanation for rising energy prices is a cover for what is really happening  that power companies have simply started charging more for an essential commodity regardless of whether it is in short supply presented with the chronicle s findings gary ackerman a representative for the western power trading forum a trade group representing power companies said the calculations support the industry position that electricity demand is growing strong that s pretty healthy growth for california as opposed to the long term historical average which is close to percent he said to me that s really strong growth energy demand is certainly on the rise in california growth of more than percent is still double what was projected and the state has obviously fallen behind in building power plants even though a recent study found california ranked th out of the states in per capita energy consumption the surging demand explanation has become so accepted that leading officials accept it as gospel gov gray davis has made energy conservation percent at that a centerpiece of his efforts to solve the crisis energy use is growing said state sen john burton d san francisco citing the growth of silicon valley and high tech operations statewide there s been tremendous growth whether manufacturing or high tech cell phones faxes whatever the stuff is growing yet the energy industry has been steadfast in its insistence that the consumer is largely to blame in testimony and submissions to government bodies considering prescriptions for the crisis energy demand growth has consistently been overstated joe bob perkins the chief operating officer of houston based reliant energy inc told the u s senate in january that california s growing economy and high summer temperatures caused electricity use to surge dramatically a demand growth of percent richard wheatley a spokesman for reliant said perkins testimony was based on estimates by the federal energy information administration of monthly retail electricity sales we do stand by that wheatley said unfortunately it does not track with iso data the industry backed edison electric institute said in a report that electricity demand grew by anywhere from percent to percent during the spring of compared with the same period a year earlier russell tucker an economist for the institute said the group s figures were derived by identifying the single highest hour of electricity demand for each spring month of and and comparing them finding the may peak rose percent granted the state energy commission uses the same model to determine whether california has enough plant capacity to meet demand but the presentation makes it appear that overall demand not just the absolute peak is growing by percent when the peak of each day is averaged and compared from year to year may s figure was much lower percent also nowhere did edison s report note that the peak hour of a load of megawatts on aug was actually lower than the peak hours of either of the previous two years on july or on sept  the chronicle analysis of average peak demand showed that no month last year grew more than june s percent though no blackouts occurred in that month may and june were the only months when demand growth exceeded percent the analysis showed most months recorded percent or percent and some such as september were less than percent two months october and december had demand levels lower than the year before percent less for october percent lower for december mike florio a consumer lawyer and board member of the iso said that even growth of less than percent from to would seem overstated since was a relatively mild weather year and was a much hotter one you are quite right florio said skyrocketing demand is a myth market manipulation consumer representatives and some politicians have long suspected that rather than dire imbalances between supply and demand market manipulation is behind the crisis generators and power marketers adamantly deny this saying they have done everything they could to keep the lights on they say they ran aging decrepit plants at higher than normal levels last summer to accommodate what they described as unprecedented demand they also say that at great expense they delayed much needed maintenance in order to keep the power flowing their claims have received some support from the federal energy regulatory commission which said in a report last month that it found no evidence power companies were using maintenance schedules to manipulate supply the report however was heavily qualified by the ferc which said it did not investigate other forms of manipulation moreover the agency acknowledged that the bulk of its investigation was conducted by simply calling power plants and questioning them over the telephone the supply side of the energy equation is harder to penetrate in part because supply data are confidential thus the question of how blackouts could have occurred at such low levels of demand in january is hard to answer what is clear is that at times during the crisis this year as much as megawatts of electricity supply have been unavailable for use mostly because of unplanned plant outages about four times the level anticipated by the iso power companies say the old plants they bought were not capable of producing to the levels sketched out by the iso and the energy commission and that everything from low water conditions emissions limitations and high temperatures last year caused less energy to be available than was anticipated but others suggest that what began as a shortage caused by a withholding of supply to drive up price has turned into one caused by withholdings out of fear of not being paid what did go up unquestionably were wholesale electricity prices while average electricity usage during the heaviest hours last year increased by less than percent prices charged by power companies to the utilities that deliver juice to consumers increased more than percent in june the cost of a megawatt hour increased more than fivefold going from the level of to in october prices doubled over the same period a year earlier going from to and in december despite a percent decline in electricity usage from the previous december peak wholesale electricity prices hit they d been one year before then the pace of price increases began to accelerate within the last six months of overall average peak usage during december was about megawatts about a fifth lower than it was in august average prices in december they just about doubled to a megawatt hour the companies explanation for rising prices despite falling demand was that more and more plants had to be taken offline for repairs decreasing supply even given the high number of inoperable plants questions remain about why the existing supply could not cover demand on the blackout days of jan and fewer plants were offline and more electricity was available than on days when the state managed to squeeze by without turning out the lights even today with stage alerts having faded away at least temporarily demand levels remain more or less the same as when california was in a constant state of emergency moreover the lists of offline plants are as long as ever ample power should exist the energy commission and the iso have concluded that california s power plants are capable of generating more than megawatts of electricity that means that even with plant repair outages low water levels decreasing hydraulic generation air pollution rules and other environmental constraints the power companies should be able to accommodate all but the most extreme spikes in demand according to industry data obtained by the chronicle the western systems coordinating council a government backed trade group in salt lake city concluded california would have considerable surpluses throughout including margins as high as percent in december based on data provided to it by the iso even under low water conditions the iso reported the state would have total power resources of megawatts in that month yet unplanned outages were far higher and the system began to crash that month and into this year at far lower levels of demand clearly florio said we should not be having a shortage at a m on christmas eve when the only person awake is santa claus chronicle database

there were several questions left for legal regulatory to work on at the close of our meeting today i ll try to restate them and add my initial thoughts so we can all be sure to focus on the correct problems q can tw use negotiated rate agreements for its new mm d expansion a yes independence guardian and other new pipeline projects were certificated on the basis of negotiated rate contracts the only restriction is that we need to always offer cost based recourse rate service as an alternative to negotiated rates we hope to use negotiated rate agreements for the entire mm of capacity but we won t know until the contracts are executed how much of it will be negotiated rate contracts and how much of it will be under recourse rate contracts i guess that means that in the cert app we just tell the commission that we will be at risk and that given the huge interest in the open season we have no doubts about our ability to sell the full we should also tell the commission we expect to sell the capacity using negotiated rate contracts or recourse rate contracts or a combination of both q can we give prospective customers a cafeteria style menu of options to steal jeff s term like the following yr neg rate deal at a locked in plus fuel and surcharges or whatever number we decide on y neg rate deal at a locked in plus fuel and surcharges yr neg rate deal at a locked in blah blah yr cost based recourse rate plus fuel and surcharges importantly this option is not locked in and will float with tw s actual rate levels and fuel retainage percentages a i think the answer here is yes whatever options we come up with for and we will always have to offer as well susan and steve stojic please confirm that we have the right to define specific negotiated rate options and stick to them otherwise this negotiated rate approach could get completely unstructured such that we end up with some guys taking our specific options and other guys custom tailoring weird variations like a yr day contract at for example i m not sure that would be a bad thing but we need to think about it we need to be sure we can tell a customer no and make it stick if he tries to mix and match by asking for the yr term and the rate for example i think we can lay out options of our choosing and then enforce a no substitutions policy this is sticking with the cafeteria theme but we need to be sure q if we can use the cafeteria options approach how much flexibility do we have in structuring the options a this one is hard we need to be sure that the price and term we choose to offer for options is solely within our discretion we don t want to be second guessed by ferc as to whether we should have offered option at instead of susan and steve if you guys confirm that we have discretion in how to structure our negotiated rate options does that mean we can slant the economics of the negotiated rate options so they are a better deal than the recourse option for most shippers i e could we deliberately incent shippers to sign on for the short term deals i e by offering options at and instead of the and shown above i suspect that is what guardian and the other pipes did to obtain subscription under neg rate deals q how do we allocate capacity to customers if demand exceeds supply a ideally we d be able to allocate the to the guys who want to buy it the way we d prefer to sell it under the above example assuming stan danny and steve decide short term deals are better what if we get mm d of offers on each of the rate term options described above that s mm d of demand for a mm d project can we sell to the guys who want option yrs and the remaining to the yr guys that really hoses the recourse bidders do we have to cover the recourse demand first and then allocate the remaining capacity pro rata to everyone else pro rata to everyone under the rule that negotiated rate bids have to be deemed to be at max rate for purposes of allocation pro rata to everyone may be the right answer or at least its the answer until we ve filled the recourse rate guys orders then we can give the remaining capacity to the neg rate guys whose bids we value most highly using some objective nondiscriminatory calculation of course ugh susan and steve please take a crack at questions i think is answered already i haven t done any research yet so maybe these questions are easier than they currently seem to me get me and mkm on the phone at your convenience to discuss we ve gotta move quick so the marketers can get out and sell this stuff df,0

forwarded by mark ect legal taylor hou ect on pm mark elliott am to mark e haedicke hou ect ect cc mark ect legal taylor hou ect ect alan b aronowitz hou ect ect scott sefton lon ect ect subject proposed fx and interest rate desk in india mark further to my e mail to you of last week on the above subject i have now reviewed the due diligence which was undertaken by enron houston with local indian counsel crawford bailey co on the above topic in january that due diligence reveals the following prior reserve bank of india rbi approval required to do business in india if enron is considered to be doing business in india which it would for example if we had a branch or entity there we shall require the prior consent of the rbi under section a foreign exchange regulation act fera e g to set up the branch or entity please note that at the date of the opinion from indian counsel th january indian counsel opined that no guidelines had been set down as to any conditions necessary to be satisfied by a foreign company in order to obtain approval from the rbi to do business in india this needs to be revisited as to the requirements repatriation of proceeds exchange control please note that in the approval which would need to be obtained from the rbi such approval would state whether the revenues generated in india could be repatriated e g to the usa or not i assume that we would require such ability to repatriate and so we shall have to ensure that the rbi approval covered it we also need to check if there are now any limits to such repatriation fx interest rate dealings a it would appear that if we open a desk in india for fx and interest rate products for the enron group i e an internal treasury desk to trade with dealers in india then dealings would be required to be in accordance with either the rules framed by the rbi or otherwise specifically approved by the rbi b fx products could be entered into with authorised dealers in india and would be subject to limitations on dealings in foreign exchange imposed by the fera please note that if transactions are outside the scope of the general rules framed by the rbi and which are not otherwise specifically approved by the rbi this may result in a contravention of fera it is not clear what are the exact ramifications of dealings in contravention of fera this needs to be investigated c what are the rules of fera see a above it appears that the rbi requires authorised dealers in india to ensure that their customers are actually exposed to exchange risk in respect of a genuine underlying transaction before entering into rate protection transactions to hedge their exposure to movements in currency rates or interest rates and authorised dealers are required to satisfy themselves that underlying commitments are firm and that forward cover is not being provided for merely anticipated deals the opinion does not state how this verification is obtained by the dealer it appears however that there was a relaxation of the rules shortly before the due diligence was undertaken whereby authorised dealers could offer certain derivative products in certain circumstances to corporates either by booking a transaction overseas or on a back to back basis without seeking the approval of the rbi these transactions are the following interest rate swaps currency swaps coupon swaps purchase of interest rate caps collars forward rate agreements in order to take advantage of that relaxation however the authorised dealers are required to ensure that i the rbi has given final approval for the conclusion of the underlying loan transactions ii the notional principal amount of the hedge does not exceed the outstanding amount of the loan iii the maturity of the hedge does not exceed the remaining life to maturity of the underlying loan iv the board of directors of the corporate to have approved a once and for all basis is sufficient the relevant financial limits and the authorised designated officials who can conclude the hedge transactions please note that the derivatives mentioned above concern the hedging of underlying loan transactions hence query e g whether a simple currency swap just to hedge exposure in one currency where there is no actual underlying loan has the benefit of any exemption and if not query how one obtains the prior approval of the rbi to do this this needs to be investigated if transactions cannot take advantage of an exemption we shall need to investigate how one obtains the specific approval of the rbi to a transaction speculative transactions are void please note that transactions entered into for purely speculative reasons would be void pursuant to section of the indian contract act indian counsel opines that provided the rate or currency derivative transaction is entered into in respect of hedging or protection against an actual underlying then the transaction would be valid capacity and authority it appears that enron would also have to ensure that the transactions were covered by its objects clause and similarly that our counterparties objects clauses covered the products in which we wish to deal there is no third party protection against entities dealing outside their capacity furthermore in relation to authority to enter into transactions it would appear that we would need to authorise certain enron officials to enter into specific transactions through board resolutions or powers of attorney and that we would need to check our counterparties documentation in this regard derivatives and borrowings if we were to establish a company in india we would be subject to the companies act in relation to limitation on the quantum of monies which it could borrow any borrowing in excess of stipulated limits would be required to be sanctioned by the members in the company in general meeting accordingly in relation to derivatives transactions incidental to the borrowing of monies in foreign currency one would need to ensure that the underlying borrowing itself was sanctioned by the members of the company in general meeting the power to borrow itself must be exercised by a full meeting of the board of directors collateral it would appear that charges taken over collateral provided received for example in relation to obligations under an isda master agreement where the cash charged was situated outside india would be legal valid and binding as against the liquidator of an indian counterparty in its insolvency however the approval of the rbi to the creation of the charge pledge or mortgage would be necessary in the first instance the due diligence does not state how such approval would be gained nor does the due diligence consider outright transfers of collateral e g under english law rather than charges over the collateral nor does it deal with collateral situated locally in india these issues need to be checked choice of law and arbitration it would appear that indian entities may enter into agreements e g isda masters governed by new york or us law and it would appear that provisions for arbitration would work insurance business indian counsel opined that interest rate fx derivative transactions would not be categorised as insurance business in india income tax please note that if an enron entity or a branch of an enron entity was set up in india or if enron appointed an agent there to undertake such business then any income arising to the enron entity branch in india from a derivative transaction would be subject to indian income tax please note however that there are double taxation agreements with usa uk and singapore with india however no details of rates of taxation or further explanation of the mechanics of the double taxation agreements are given in the opinion gross up clauses contractual gross up clauses re withholdings e g the standard gross up clause in the isda master would need to be approved by the rbi indian counsel does not state how this is achieved close out netting whilst it appears that the netting concept of an isda master agreement would work according to indian counsel the existing due diligence is slightly ambiguous in that it states that an official liquidator or official assignee of an indian entity would be able to disclaim unprofitable contracts which indian counsel opines would mean the net sum e g if our indian counterparty owed us a balance on a close out against them in their insolvency this needs to be revisited with indian counsel oral contracts please note that in relation to oral contracts whilst it is possible to sue upon an oral contract in india it is not possible to take any steps for the purpose of enforcing any judgement obtained except with the permission of the rbi under section of fera indian counsel does not state how such approval this would be obtained and how long it would take to obtain mark i suggest that we should have a brief discussion concerning the above before i take any further action on the above kind regards mark apart from obtaining the consent from the rbi to set up a branch or a subsidiary in india and then to obtain the permission to repatriate to the us any proceeds of such business there did not appear to be any other trade control or other laws which would inhibit enron s ability to do business in india,0

d pacific gas electric co pg e in filings with the california public utilities commission cpuc and california independent system operator cal iso has requested that a rate cap be placed on wholesale purchases  in the state the utility is asking the cpuc to lower the current rate cap from per megawatt hour to or cents per kilowatt hour in seeking the rate cap pg e is joined by edison international the parent  company of southern california edison and the utility action network turn  a ratepayer advocacy group analysis the current rate cap of per megawatt hour in the wholesale  market of california resulted from the price spikes experienced in san diego this summer as san diego gas electric had paid off its stranded costs the retail rate freeze in its area was lifted and sdg e customers were exposed to market based prices which doubled and at times tripled due to increased demand in the state and power supply concerns pg e customers were not exposed to the price spikes because at the time pg e had not paid off its own stranded costs and was still under a retail rate freeze yet the company has felt the impact from the price spikes just the same pg e buys a great deal of its power on the wholesale market and as a resul t is about billion in debt some figures suggest it is as high as  billion due to the retail rate freeze still in effect pg e has been unable to pass this debt on to customers by raising its rates in real terms pg e was paying up to cents per kilowatt hour on the wholesale market this summer when by law it was only allowed to charge its customers  on average cents per kilowatt hour in total pg e has paid about billion more to suppliers than it can bill customers for and this amount  is growing by hundreds of millions each month this explains the utility s  motivation in wanting to see the cpuc further lower the cap on wholesale rates in california however even though pg e as a whole is in debt the utility as well as  other divisions under parent company pg e corp is still making money of f deregulation in california for instance pg e s diablo canyon nuclear plant has been able to capitalize on the high value of power on the wholesa le market the utility confirmed recently that altogether its power facilities  the ones left after the utility was forced to divest the bulk of its power assets still provide about million a month to the utility in addit ion pg e corp s unregulated energy commodity trading operation has been doing  very well and the unregulated national energy group which operates in  markets outside of california such as massachusetts rhode island and new hampshire posted a percent profit increase for the second quarte r thus it is important to note the distinction between pg e and its parent  pg e corp ironically as a whole pg e corp has stated that it does not  support rate caps and has opposed the issue when it has surfaced in other  states pg e reported second quarter earnings of million on billion in revenue representing a percent increase over the same quarter last year third quarter earnings also reportedly will be strong this puts pg e in an awkward predicament on one hand pg e wants to convince shareholders that the company is doing well and making money from the commodities that  it sells on the other hand pg e is attempting to convince regulators that it is losing money due to the high wholesale prices that it must pay  for power in fairness though the revenue pg e has earned cannot come anywhere near to paying off the massive debt the company has accrued due to its obligation of serving customers pg e s rate freeze is scheduled to end march at the very latest  or sooner if it is determined that pg e s stranded costs have been repaid  something that utility executives say may already have taken place due to higher than expected revenues and higher than market valuations of the  utility s assets it may very well be the case that pg e s stranded costs  are already paid off when this is officially determined by the cpuc pg e  will argue that customers should be liable for some or all of the debt it has assumed while the rate caps were in place the cpuc has scheduled a hearing to address these issues on oct the core question of these proceedings will be whether or not pg e should be allowed to turn over its debt to customers through rate increases once the rate freeze is lifted  pg e wants to be able to retroactively bill customers for its debt based  on the date which the cpuc determines that pg e had in fact paid off its stranded costs a point groups such as turn will surely protest it may seem surprising that turn was among the group with pg e that filed  the petition to lower the rate cap on wholesale prices typically turn and pg e along with most utilities are at polar opposites regarding most  issues however both agree that wholesale rates are too high and want to see a new cap put into place but for completely different reasons turn says that pg e and other utilities took a risk when agreeing to the rate freeze and they should not be allowed to pass debts that resulted from that risk onto customers turn continues to retain a watch over the proceedings related to pg e s proposal specifically with regard to the possibility that the cpuc will allow the utility to raise rates on customer s within the course of these new developments it s important to be clear on pg e s motivations some california lawmakers and consumer advocates have called for a complete return to regulation arguing that deregulation  in california has become a failed experiment many have surmised that pg e s proposal for wholesale caps is essentially a call to return california to a regulated structure i think this is a misinterpretation pg e has very clearly stated that its proposal is a necessary short term step to try to bring prices back in line pg e s efforts really shouldn t be viewe d as a move to return california to a regulated market rather pg e is merel y attempting to protect its own interests the utility wants to secure temporary lower rates for the power it needs to buy on the wholesale market and transfer its debts to customers once the rate freeze is lifted a return to regulati on via a permanent rate cap would not be in pg e s best interests as it continues to sell power from its nuclear plant in addition pg e probably recognizes  that regulation would discourage additional companies from building new power plants in california which would not be good for the long term econo my of the state this also would do little to lower wholesale prices in california as we discovered this summer the less supply the higher the price for power pg e s proposal to lower rate caps on wholesale prices is more than anythi ng else an attempt to protect itself from what it perceives as disastrous economic impact if it is not able to transfer its debt to customers a recent wall street journal report inferred that if wholesale prices continu e to exceed what pg e can charge customers the utility could become technically insolvent sometime next year it will be interesting to see if the cpuc has the same perception when it evaluates pg e s proposal later this month  d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d

why is enron s stock so volatile now since today s session started ene has lost another mr ken lay replies i haven t had a chance to check our stock today but i think for several reasons it s more volatile but before i comment on that our stock price is still up even if it went down that much today it s up since the beginning of the year when the dow was down as recently as mid december the stock price is up about that s one reason why it s so volatile some people bought in along the way they ve had a good strong increase particularly with the uncertainty in the marketplace people just want to take some money off the table as we become more of a technology stock a high p e stock a growth stock held by growth portfolios you re going to have more volatility just like all the other companies that fit into that category throughout the market technology stocks quite often go up or down not just a whack but often a whack what i tell mark koenig is i love that volatility on the upside but i hate it on the down side we ve had a change in the ownership of our stock increasingly it s being bought by the growth portfolio managers and increasingly it s being sold by the value and other portfolio managers that picked it up at much lower valuations and now at these values they want to take their money and put it back into lower p e stocks i know this makes everybody a little nervous but this is probably the world we re in now i d rather be in this world with a p e than the more stable world with a p e,0

burton hertzberg forwarded by jeff dasovich na enron on pm costigan richard richard costigan asm ca gov pm to cc subject appeal court ruling on burton hertzberg appeals court declines to order energy price caps updated may p m san francisco a federal appeals court declined tuesday to order federal energy regulators to cap wholesale electricity prices the decision by a three judge panel of the th u s circuit court of appeals came hours before california gov gray davis was to urge president bush in century city to cap wholesale power costs which have been spiraling out of control the panel in a brief statement said last week s appeal by state senate president john burton and state assembly speaker robert hertzberg does not warrant intervention of this court the lawmakers both democrats were joined by the city of oakland in their appeal to the th circuit the citizens of california are suffering immediate irreparable harm as a result of ferc s abrogation of its duty to establish just and reasonable rates for electricity they wrote to the th circuit which has jurisdiction over ferc the lawmakers said california s looming threat of continued blackouts are an imminent threat to the health welfare and safety of every california citizen the suit came after more than a year of wholesale power prices reaching historically high levels in december prices in california reached per megawatt hour and they have skyrocketed to as much as per megawatt hour during peak times since then the bush administration ardently opposes price caps and president bush has declined davis requests to urge ferc to impose strict caps vice president dick cheney chief architect of the administration s energy plan has said capping prices would not increase energy supplies or reduce demand we get politicians who want to go out and blame somebody and allege there is some kind of conspiracy instead of dealing with the real issues cheney has said cheney criticized davis a democrat for what he called a harebrained scheme to use the state s budget surplus to buy power because california s two largest utilities face enormous financial problems for the short term the bush administration has approved davis request to expedite permits for new power plants and has ordered federal facilities in california to reduce energy consumption percent this summer sacramento and the white house appear locked in a high voltage war of rhetoric over energy policies there is broad bipartisan dissatisfaction in sacramento with washington s response to california s energy crisis the result of its own deregulation rules last month ferc did order a one year cap on electricity sold into california during power emergencies when power reserves fall below percent the agency did not set a price and also required the state to join a regional transmission organization which could limit california s ability to control its own power grid davis called the plan a trojan horse and state power regulators dismissed the cap as inadequate saying it would profit power generators at ratepayers expense in addition davis and state lawmakers sharply criticized ferc for considering requiring the state s power grid operator to add a surcharge on power sales to pay generators the money they are owed by the state s two large financially strapped utilities the case is burton v federal energy regulatory

i guess i would only request that we get some review put in front of ets new risk management officer and his crew jerry peters i also understand that this is a part of the revenue management project lisa sawyer pm to rod hayslett fgt enron enron cc steve hotte corp enron enron caroline barnes fgt enron enron lee ferrell et s enron enron subject ets risk system rod caroline forwarded me your questions regarding the risk system so i wanted to go ahead and respond since steve is out this week i don t think philippe requires the level of due diligence that we performed but we were getting questioned on buying a rd party product vs using an enron risk system we did more research and got the other groups involved so that they would understand our decision i believe everyone is now comfortable with our purchase decision in our analysis of systems we selected the caminus product in part because we had several individual references from arthur andersen deliotte touche and ernst young these organizations especially arthur andersen have audited this application and have actually participated in numerous implementations ernst young recently selected caminus for equitable resources arthur anderson implemented the application for conoco and or other companies and deloitte touche recently selected the product for tractabel after talking with individuals from these accounting firms we felt very confident that the product was sound and we should not have audit concerns obviously we have a lot of business procedures that have to be established and there is time in the work plan to do that work but a lot of those decisions drive how the application is configured so we need to get the product purchased work through the details of how we implement the new business procedures since the system does drive a lot of processes regarding costs we have an approved work order for which covers all the initial hardware software implementation costs and first year maintenance this cost does represent a very limited implementation with only concurrent users no customization except a few reports and no electronic interfaces or data conversion the assumption is that initially the volume would be so low that an automated interface may not be cost justified and the data would manually be loaded since it was low volume as well the on going costs are estimated at approximately year we did not perform a separate cost benefit analysis as this was in the original cost of the revenue management raroc let me know if you have any other questions or there are open issues that we need to address prior to completing the contract we are hoping to get this signed and the project underway next week thanks,0

i found this on a sailing magazine web page an acquaintance who is a professor of literature at stanford brought patrick o brian to my attention claiming him to be the finest living author writing in the english language being an avid reader who had consumed about everything including of course all of forster s hornblower books i had my doubts but after an increasingly mesmerizing reading of all of the sixteen o brian aubrey maturin novels then in print with ever mounting captivation and awe i wholeheartedly concurred after a second reading of the entire series which revealed to me previously undiscovered depths and glories i felt compelled to pay down the debt i owed this author for the wonderful life enriching experience he had given me since o brian obviously loved the sea it occurred to me to write offering him a fortnight s cruse aboard my perini ketch the foot andromeda la dea for himself and his friends without any interfering presence from myself i asked danielle steel if she thought o brian would be offended by receiving such a letter and her interesting reply was i get about letters per year from readers and i have yet to receive a single one offering to do anything for me he will be delighted even if age and circumstances prevent him from accepting so i wrote via his publisher having literally no idea where in the world he lived and after some forwarding delay i received his handwritten reply in his fine and precise penmanship saying i accept your kind offer with perhaps obscene haste as mr o brian was to give a lecture tour of the united states in early that included san francisco i invited him to dinner the week of his visit and i first saw him in person when i attended his lecture in herbst hall his host was the poet laureate of america robert haas i was both charmed and alarmed when introduced to o brian s lightening quick wit and rather acerbic manner the following evening he and his wife mary came to my house in belvedere for a literary dinner with admirers and one or two other authors mr o brian was utterly charming if perhaps a little aloof he took tremendous interest in an admiralty board dockyard model i have of an english first rater of he understood everything about that ship and greatly augmented my own knowledge after the other guests departed we settled into a series of brandies by the fire and i discovered his capacity for serious drinking greatly exceeded my own his reserve only eased very slightly in the presence of this unknown american me and his knowledge of the practical aspects of sailing seemed amazingly almost nil after a half liter of cognac had vanished and we were still calling each other mr o brian and mr perkins i produced a chart of the mediterranean and we began to discuss the agenda for his cruise i had learned that the o brians home was in collioure a village on the mediterranean coast of france just north of the spanish border in basque country the harbor of port vendres lies nearby where andromeda could pick all of them up o brian then suggested a cruise circumnavigating sicily a stop in greece dropping by beirut and winding up with a comprehensive tour of the balearic islands i was stunned how i wondered could this old salt possibly comprehend a tour of over nautical miles with numerous port calls in only days in a yacht capable of only about knots as i began to explain the physical limitations of time and space he added a desire to drop the hook in naples capri and tangiers as well while i could not reconcile this plan with reality i assumed it was the wine in control and then i was both startled and pleased when he added at the evening s end that he had a major non negotiable condition to accepting my offer namely that i personally would join him mary and their guests aboard my yacht  in may as the departure date appoached i had a rough time getting andromeda to the tiny and picturesque port vendres in time to pick them up every time i have been in the gulf of lions i have been pasted and this was one of the worst andromeda broke her inner forestay and lost all telecommunication as well but after a real dusting we made it and o brian and mary showed me around the village and offered a lunch at their modest and charming home he took tremendous pride in his wine made from his own grapes pressed and fermented in barrels in his cellar i was fascinated by his office where the books were written it was lined floor to ceiling with reference works on an array of subjects botany geography zoology medicine etc in several languages but not a single volume dated later than he was literally immersed in the period of his work the following morning we were joined by his close friend the scholar and foremost authority on peeps richard ollard his publisher stuart proffit and his agent vivien green we finalized our itinerary with the decision to visit all the balearic islands and o brian somewhat wistfully asked if an additional stop in istanbul would not be possible told it was not he boarded radiating the impression that i was something of an indian giver short changing him on his yachting holiday underway to menorca beneath a sunny sky with a twenty knot following wind the sailing was marvelous and o brian was delighted i introduced him to the helm but he seemed to have no feeling for the wind and the course and frequently i had to intervene to prevent a full standing gybe i began to suspect that his autobiographical references to his months at sea as a youth were fanciful he had no idea of the limitations of even a big yacht like andromeda in terms of the handling and actual distance we could cover in a day however he and mary adapted quickly to the yacht with no trace of seasickness mary quiet kind interesting and interested was wonderful to have aboard however she was very frail they were both nearly and i constantly feared she would take a tumble with the ship s motion but thankfully this never occurred before dinner o brian asked me if i was familiar with an american drink called the martini and he tested my composition of two such killers with relish all the conversations at the table were spirited and he was the center of the talk and controlled its direction totally i found the level of sophistication and erudition of these people to be greater than any i had ever experienced and when they turned to literary or historical contexts i was left far behind my mit engineer s degree had alas not prepared me for cultivated discourse at such a level it was literally exhausting but a marvel to follow the weather continued to be fine and the next morning we were off menorca o brian suggested that we sail sail not motor into the long narrow channel leading to the port of mahon the location of the first meeting between aubrey and maturin this was pretty tricky for a boat of andromeda s size but i carried it off happily without mishap we had an interesting afternoon ashore with o brian showing us about the old city with intense enthusiasm while also demonstrating his fluency in catalan the local tongue that evening while at dinner back aboard the yacht he suggested for the first time that i call him patrick and he would use tom for me and so our cruise continued with patrick showing keen interest in everything we fished with some success we sailed every day we visited the port of ciudadela on menorca and we sailed past the majestic cape formentor on the northeast tip of mallorca where patrick was entranced by the thousands of sea birds ornithology was his true passion as it was for his character stephen maturin who is clearly modeled on patrick s physique and personality  one evening there was an extremely heated discussion around the table which led to hurt feelings requiring overnight to heal it started with patrick asking me if i had heard of a place indiana and a school the university of indiana and did i think the school financially responsible the university s english department had purchased and not yet paid for two or three of patrick s manuscripts and had a professor offering a course on o brian which patrick found intensely offensive patrick then mentioned that he was destroying all of his diaries his journals and all of his correspondence so that no trace of his existence would remain save his novels richard ollard was aghast and ms green was very upset with this quite startling revelation ollard said that it was a crime against the future and reminded patrick that he himself had relied heavily on pablo picasso s letters when he had written a well received biography of the artist patrick heatedly countered that picasso had trusted him but that he patrick could not rely upon the goodwill of some post doctoral american fool so the tension filled discussion continued the analogy of an artist framing his painting was raised it was then complete and should not require either the support nor deserve the distraction of knowing the artist s frame of mind at the time of creation now after patrick s death we understand some of his thinking he was his own construct born patrick russ english not irish not university educated not a sailor a father who abandoned his family and altogether a piece of his own fiction but that night aboard andromeda only mary knew the truth and understood his deep motives the following day the unpleasantness passed with more superb sailing in fine mediterranean weather while under full sail with the huge mps drawing in light wind with our centerboard keel raised and guided by as it turned out an inaccurate spanish chart we decided to sail between the coast and a small island and we ran firmly aground in shallow water in the med one can t simply wait for a higher tide so we emptied all our fresh water tanks and tried to back off no luck i blew out the water in our centerboard trunk with compressed air over ten tons still no luck finally we tied a long hawser to a rock astern and using our anchor windlass to bar tight tension we slowly worked our way off waggling to and fro with our bow thruster patrick was delighted with all these nautical operations he nearly believed i thought that we had arranged the event for his entertainment one morning at breakfast after our friendship had become more firmly established patrick said tom i wish to ask you an embarrassing question which will reveal my utter and total ignorance of all things in this modern world what is software my answer the piano is the hardware and the sheet music is the software satisfied him and upon reflection myself as well every afternoon between two and five patrick retired to my on board office to work on his novel the yellow admiral then in progress he borrowed the yacht s charts of france particularly the area around brest to incorporate detail of the blockade of brest which is featured in that book very much to mary s surprise he showed me each day s progress she said that he had never shared his work with anyone before completion later patrick sent me the original manuscript for this volume which i still keep aboard and which i treasure thus we cruised for ten days arriving in palma where the demands of business required that all of patrick s guests and i depart he and mary continued on to ibiza with the yacht s crew for three further days mostly to study that island s renowned bird colonies then they sailed uneventfully back to port vendres my friendship with patrick continued until his death in january of this year we corresponded he and mary stayed in my home they were aboard my schooner mariette we met at his club brooks in london he was a genius and his books remain a towering towering achievement i miss him greatly tom perkins

any insight it would be greatly appreciated mike forwarded by michael etringer hou ect on pm steve c hall am to michael etringer hou ect ect cc subject article on ab x mike here is an article on the qf bill small electric producers ok big price cut by ed mendel staff writer february sacramento legislators said yesterday that small generators who produce about percent of the state s power have agreed to cut their power prices in half an important step toward easing the electricity crisis negotiations continued on what gov gray davis has called the final step the state purchase of the transmission systems of the three investor owned utilities in exchange for paying off their huge debt meanwhile the amount that the state is spending to buy power for the customers of the utilities grows officials gave notice that an additional  million will be needed in days bringing the total to billion but for the first time in nearly six weeks the state did not declare an alert yesterday due to power shortages more power was available from other states and some power plants that had been shut down for maintenance resumed operation two legislators sen jim battin r palm desert and assemblyman fred keeley d boulder creek said they introduced legislation that sharply reduces the prices paid to small generators after weeks of difficult negotiations ultimately this bill will reduce the cost of energy to the state and its ratepayers by billions of dollars said battin who represents eastern san diego county about half of the small generators use renewable technologies such as solar wind geothermal and biomass the rest is co generation when fuel is used for industrial purposes and electricity is generated as a by product the small generators have grown to produce nearly a third of california s power under a two decade old federal qualifying facilities program which requires utilities to buy their power battin and keeley said that under the bill sb x the average price for these qf contracts could drop from the current cents per kilowatt hour to about to cents per kilowatt hour we believe that the rates are at least that low if not lower said jan smutny jones executive director of the independent energy producers which represents small and large generators the small generators support the bill because it will give them a stable price for five years avoiding ups and downs and the possibility that state regulators might make a more unfavorable price cut much of the current price formula is based on the price of natural gas at the california border which has soared this winter the legislation spreads the price bench mark over a five year period we encourage the legislature to take quick action to approve sb x as quickly as possible to help stabilize the electricity crisis smutny jones said he said one of the side agreements to the legislation is the creation of a portfolio of long term contracts to purchase natural gas for some co generators lowering their production costs the legislation was applauded as a major step forward by a group of small generators who formed a creditors committee last week and threatened to take the utilities into bankruptcy we call on the legislature and the governor to act on it immediately said chris thompson a spokesman for the group thompson said southern california edison continues to collect money from ratepayers as the state buys power for its customers but is not paying anything to the small non polluting generators a spokesman for a geothermal generator in el centro which filed a lawsuit seeking million from edison for power provided since november welcomed the legislation for giving generators stability and ratepayers cheaper power but vince signorotti a spokesman for calenergy said it would be premature to consider dropping the lawsuit battin and keeley said that payment of the small generators depends on the governor s attempt to negotiate the purchase of the transmission systems of edison pacific gas and electric and san diego gas and electric in exchange for payment of their debt as part of the governor s plan the utilities would agree to provide low cost power for five to years from their generators which provide about a third of the state s power davis aides are attempting to negotiate long term contracts with generators for the remaining third of the power required by the state sharply reducing the cost of buying power on the expensive spot market but the governor said this week that many generators are reluctant to sign long term contracts until they know how the utilities will pay their debt for previous power purchases the state called off all power alerts yesterday for the first time since mid january rescinding a stage alert declared wednesday grid operators made the change after increased power supplies became available the supply situation this week has gradually been improving said lorie o donley a spokeswoman with the california independent system operator which manages most of the state s power supplies however she said the improvements shouldn t deter consumers from conservation it is good news to be out of electrical emergencies but we just want to remind everybody that we are looking at a long term power supply situation here she said and the high demand summer is just around the corner so we would ask that people continue with their conservation efforts in san francisco yesterday state power regulators decided unanimously that the department of water resources is responsible for buying any power that cash strapped utilities are unable to generate or buy on their own no matter what price wholesalers are charging but the puc voted against taking action that would have allowed the dwr to receive a portion of ratepayer revenues from the utilities to help cover the cost of buying electricity the state through the dwr was authorized by a recent law to buy power for the utilities edison and pg e have such low credit ratings that no power companies will sell to them sdg e s rating is much better but its debt also was mounting the dwr purchases that portion of electricity beyond what the utilities provide through their own generating plants and through existing long term contracts but the dwr has refused to buy power beyond a certain price that means more last minute power purchases on the expensive spot market the utilities and the state had disagreed over how the dwr will be reimbursed whether through state bonds or ratepayer dollars and the extent of its power buying role the author of the bill authorizing the long term contracts assemblyman keeley said the legislation s intent was to fully cover the one third of the power that utilities purchased on the spot market either through extended contracts or through the state iso staff writer karen kucher and the associated press contributed to this report,0

appeared in the chicago tribune today of interest please don t shoot the messenger deregulation not the problem by philip r o connor philip r o connor is president of chicago based newenergy midwest the leading provid er of august the firestorm raging in the san diego area that devours homes and likely will be followed in the spring by mudslides that will carry homes into ravines isn t what midwesterners are used to but there s no blaming bad ol el nino this time the firestorm that has everyone pointing fingers has to do with electric power shortages rolling blackout warnings and summer utility bills that have soared two and threefold over last summer s to avoid wearing the jacket in our chicago patois california s voter shy public officials and utility executives are blaming bad ol deregulation understandably but regrettably the media have tended to follow the story line that electricity deregulation is to blame such stories could well create worry that deregulation in illinois and elsewhere in the midwest will lead to san diego style problems if anything deregulation in the midwest is avoiding the fundamental errors california made not only during the two years of deregulation but during the decade preceding deregulation in the summer of the midwest had some close calls of its own when triple digit temperatures drove wholesale electric prices for certain midday hours to as much as times the normal price the reigning theories in the california panic today are much like the myths that emerged in the midwest back then there were allegations of price gouging by power producers and warnings that we were moving too fast toward deregulation even though there was no retail deregulation and competition in the midwest at that time in fact it was the lack of retail customer level competition that allowed the wholesale market to fly completely out of control since the midwest has begun to get its act together in california the initial reactions are to put the toothpaste back in the tube and to burn the witch but my native state still will need to face up to its legacy of thinking i ll do that tomorrow while at the same time trying to regulate free markets as if there were no tomorrow deregulation which started in california in the spring of is but a messenger of painful truths the truth is that the chickens are coming home to roost and that any attempt to retreat into the past will produce more power shortages and higher prices there are some big differences between illinois the first state in the midwest to open up the electric network for customer choice and california the first state in the nation to open up the network for competition in spite of a booming california economy spurring massive increases in electrical demand not one new power plant came on line during the s and none since california thought it could rely on power plants in other western states but those plants are now serving growing loads in their own areas in illinois and elsewhere in the midwest new clean natural gas fired plants are able to serve during periods of peak demand gov ryan has convened a committee to review state and local government handling of proposed peaker plants it seems likely to keep strict environmental standards in place while helping to identify ways to reduce uncertainties speed up approvals or disapprovals and thereby reduce costs and improve power reliability while the midwest is realizing the benefit of newly constructed transmission lines that allow access by chicago and other areas to competitive power supplies many areas in california remain too dependent on just a few local power plants in california once a utility finishes collecting stranded cost charges to pay off investments in nuclear plants and high cost power contracts price caps for plain old utility service based on rates in place prior to deregulation are lifted that s why san diego gas electric the first utility to finish collecting stranded costs merely had the job of acquiring power in the wholesale market and passing along the cost to customers who had not switched to new competitive suppliers in illinois and ohio by contrast utility rates are capped at reduced levels for at least five more years for customers who do not switch illinois and the midwest have stayed away from such rube goldberg contraptions as the california power exchange that was supposed to serve as a sort of mandatory clearing house for wholesale power transactions but instead became a sort of private regulator that regulated no better than the government used to the rules of the game in the golden state could not have been more skewed against giving opportunities for customers to switch to new competitors or to take other precautions to avoid high summer power prices during an unexpected heat wave my newenergy colleagues in california have faced an ever shifting set of increasingly inhospitable rules in illinois utilities and new competitive suppliers have had more flexibility to offer products that let customers choose between fixed prices that balance out the ups and downs of the market or prices that float with the seasons importantly illinois regulators have been reasonably quick to approve proposals that let utilities and new suppliers such as my company work out contracts with commercial and industrial customers to reduce their electrical demand during peak summer hours in return for payments such arrangements less available in california are key to avoiding blackouts and blunting big price spikes as chairman of the illinois commerce commission from through i remember when the costs of new nuclear plants showed up in electric rates today s stranded costs i know what california utility commissioners must be going through as they seek solutions for problems with roots going back at least a decade they d better have thick skins and nimble minds i ll never forget former gov jim thompson whose campaign i co managed and who appointed me to the icc saying after several big rate increases the political equivalent of i ve never seen this man before in my entire life having been yelled at on the bus by angry consumers a

movie sounds pretty cool when is the official release date eric gillaspie pm to gerald nemec hou ect ect cc subject coen bros coens hit most notes in brother o brother where art thou southern comedy drama color pg by todd mccarthy daily variety chief film critic cannes variety a musically tinged riff on the odyssey set in the depression era deep south o brother where art thou is a charming if lightweight coen brothers escapade flecked by plenty of visual and performance grace notes picaresque tale of three cons in flight from life on a chain gang is more memorable for its fantastic moments than for its somewhat insubstantial cumulative impact which will likely translate into just ok box office results come domestic release in the fall while the film s epigraph and inspiration come from homer its title derives from preston sturges film biz classic sullivan s travels in which the successful director played by joel mccrea wants to abandon comedy to make a socially conscious drama about the human condition called o brother where art thou despite appropriating the handle the coens aren t about to fall into the trap of pretentiousness themselves crafting instead a seriocomedy that makes a fanciful tour of an old mississippi in which kismet and good bluegrass music prevail over racism and criminality working with their customary tonal precision and immaculate craftsmanship the coens release into the wilds three escaped criminals with the leader everett ulysses mcgill george clooney telling his cronies pete john turturro and delmar tim blake nelson that he knows where million is buried the first person they encounter however a blind black man driving a railway handcar warns them that they will find treasure out there but not the treasure they re seeking a preening fancy man obsessively concerned with securing the right pomade for his coiffure and given to highfalutin phraseology it s a fool who looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart he advises everett stands by as his buddies are cleansed of their sins in a mass river baptism picking up a young black musician tommy johnson chris thomas king on the road the fellows wander into an isolated radio station recording studio and posing as a group called the soggy bottom boys cut a lively tune and are paid a few bills for their efforts they then take off again and remain oblivious to the fact that the record becomes a huge hit one eventful encounter follows another as the boys make their way across the lushly verdant landscapes which have been photographed by roger deakins in slightly washed out and burnished hues that are a constant delight they hook up for a bank robbery with gleeful adrenaline freak george nelson a wonderfully live wired michael badalucco who hates his nickname babyface and goes into a huge post crime funk in a humorously lyrical sequence that represents a magical synthesis of visuals performance and music the boys come upon three sirens who seduce them in a watery glade when pete disappears thereafter the dense delmar presumes that his friend has been turned into a toad which he proceeds to carry around in a shoebox until a predatory one eyed salesman for the word of god a cyclops like john goodman squeezes the critter to death while beating the other two silly pete eventually turns up again only to become perturbed when everett reveals that his real goal rather than the nonexistent treasure is to reunite with the mother of his seven daughters penny holly hunter who is about to marry another fellow in the course of things the errant adventurers brush up against local politics a governor s race that pits old incumbent pappy o daniel charles durning against a reform candidate whose motto friend of the little man is literally represented by a broom toting dwarf who accompanies him at every campaign stop after slipping in a quiet homage to sullivan s travels in which members of a chain gang are given a little recreation at a picture show the coens deliver one of their major set pieces a stupendously choreographed ku klux klan rally that is disrupted by the boys in a fashion that slyly evokes the invasion of the wicked witch s castle by dorothy s friends in the wizard of oz raucous the devil gets his due musical climax is fun and given a big charge by durning in a splendid performance capping turn but is also rather too fairy tale ish and too good to be true to truly satisfy leaving this an odyssey without full closure lack of irony and complexity in the wrap up may be a shortcoming but it also points up the welcome absence of condescension and ridicule in the film s portrait of dimwits con men rednecks and country folk most of the characters including the three leads may be dumb misguided and delusional but they are also engaging and straightforward to be enjoyed for the colorful oddballs that they are not for the first time recalling clark gable in his looks and line delivery clooney clearly delights in embellishing everett s vanity and in delivering the coens carefully calibrated high toned dialogue turturro and nelson a character actor who directed the indie eye of god and the upcoming othello update o are a real dumb and dumber combo without veering into slapstick while supporting cast reflects the typical coen richness from durning and well known regulars goodman and hunter through stephen root as the blind recording entrepreneur musician king as the boys sometime collaborator and daniel von bargen as a relentless sheriff who pursues the escapees to the bitter end not as elaborate as the hudsucker proxy or the big lebowski pic is nonetheless a modest technical marvel in which deakins splendid camerawork blends seamlessly with dennis gassner s evocative production design mary zophres imaginative costumes and some special and digital effects that are all but imperceptible as such watch for that cow delta blues music a combo of t bone burnett and pre existing tunes is another major plus everett ulysses mcgill george clooney pete john turturro delmar tim blake nelson pappy o daniel charles durning big dan teague john goodman george nelson michael badalucco penny holly hunter radio station man stephen root tommy johnson chris thomas king homer stokes wayne duvall sheriff cooley daniel von bargen pappy s staff j r horne brian reddy wash hogwallop frank

thanks unfortunately i think the answers are yes and yes kathy ringblom pm to drew fossum et s enron enron cc subject re document retention well i m not sure how responsive dot s response was to your initial communication but i agree that there is a year retention policy on contracts and agreements and their backup this to me would only apply to all of the gas purchase contracts we pulled from storage most of which are probably close to the end of the years litigation workpapers which to me would include all of the pleadings correspondence discovery exhibits depositions etc have a six year retention the other documents we pulled from storage but didn t produce such as mike mcgowan s and mary kay s old files on take or pay issues ferc orders etc would have different retention policies depending upon their content questions i assume if we produced an old year plan even though it should have been destroyed long ago it would now fall under the year litigation workpaper retention policy do you think documents from the first trial have to start over and be kept for another years,0

let s sit down next week and go over this there are some other things going on that the lng group is trying to trade with el paso for lng space around the country as well jeff janet r dietrich am to jeffrey a shankman hou ect ect cc mike mcconnell hou ect ect subject southern lng re elba island lng terminal hey guys no real need to read all of this i just want to be sure your team and our team are closely coordinating on the elba island tolling agreements your team and gas sales agreements our team these discussions have been going on for about eight months now and i want to be sure this is all worthwhile phil demoes is spending a considerable amount of time coordinating and negotiating with southern co and other sales customers for the lng offtake agreements i m assuming doug arnell is your lead on deciding and executing on the strategy at elba there is a considerable amount of money to be made depending on your view of the long term supply curve for lng question are the right people involved here on both sides to develop and execute on the strategy at elba what is our specific strategy at elba and can we accelerate our negotiations on the various contracts here please advise thanks forwarded by janet r dietrich hou ect on am phil demoes enron am to janet r dietrich hou ect ect gil muhl corp enron enron ed mcmichael hou ect ect cc dan j hyvl hou ect ect subject southern lng re elba island lng terminal janet gil and ed please note les latest summary of elba things seem to be coming to a head there southern co was in town last thursday to visit us and les agreed to start working on a letter of intent with southern co for the sale of gas from the terminal we have been asked to work up a good price for gas at elba by les i have started working with john hodge and john griffith on this so co s latest offer was hub for all dt d so co wants dt d at elba and will give us the option of selling to them the remaining dt d at elba or destin at our option we have not discussed what a price at destin should be so co has some leverage with el paso that can be instrumental in helping les with his negotiations below additionally they may be the only party that can burn the high btu gas and significantly improve the btu issue at elba we should be better prepared to talk about this by wednesday let me know if you have any questions forwarded by phil demoes corp enron on am les webber enron development pm to doug arnell enron development enron development nancy corbet enron development enron development daniel r rogers enron development enron development byamagata akingump com masseye arentfox com cc shelley corman enron phil demoes corp enron enron david l fairley ect subject southern lng re elba island lng terminal greetings on november southern lng advised the ferc that it has determined to withdraw the btu stabilization options from the instant certificate application such application being the one seeking to amend the certificate issued by the ferc in march authorizing southern lng to reactivate the lng terminal at elba island with this withdrawal the el paso organization has drawn its line in the sand we plan to vigorously protest this withdrawal at the ferc within the day period allowed by ferc procedures this gives us until december to file which presumably would be extended until monday december  our filing will be of an adversarial nature so the enron organization needs to be on board with our intended filing which we will commence drafting on november drafts will be circulated to the appropriate personnel so please advise us re any additions in that regard at the same time this decision by southern lng will focus our resolve to complete the commercial transaction with el paso merchant energy we have come to accept some of the less desirable features of the letter agreement term sheet signed with el paso merchant energy on october inasmuch as the more important aspects are very much in our favor including several that southern lng found rather unsettling we will discuss the path forward with el paso merchant energy on november while we remain open to a solution to the quality issue that leaves our commercial flexibility and optionality intact we must be positioned to move forward resolutely and in a timely manner with both el paso merchant energy and southern lng we cannot afford to stop these processes while we discuss alternative solutions on wednesday november we gave both mike varagona and david jenkins of el paso merchant energy a heads up regarding our likely response to southern lng s proposed letter agreement dated november we indicated we would be asking southern lng to bifurcate the ferc proceeding into the vaporizer project that could proceed quickly and on an independent path to certification and the stabilization project that required considerably more technical analyses before it could proceed when i contacted mike varagona on friday november after we received a copy of southern lng s letter to the ferc he stated that he had not been advised by southern lng regarding its decision hence had not been positioned to return the favor mr varagona will be in houston on november and and he wants to meet with us he is still pushing for a commercial solution that sees el paso take on the quality risk in return for our firming up our volumes to el paso merchant energy at an improved price of henry hub plus approx per mmbtu let there be no doubt that el paso and southern lng will find a solution to the quality issue at little or no cost he said he would like to prepare us an outline of an offer to which i responded that he had nothing to lose by doing so the usual practice has been for enron to do this and for el paso to respond with i don t think that will work mr varagona also indicated that he did not see how the letter agreement term sheet could form the basis of the commercial arrangement between our respective companies it just won t work as a consequence he stated that clarke smith head of el paso merchant energy has already contacted or will shortly contact our mike mcconnell to see if they can work to resolve this matter apparently these gentlemen have developed a good working relationship over the years he also alluded to the possibility that mr smith may have also contacted our stan horton for less than obvious reasons to me mr varagona further advised me that a duke williams joint venture had just acquired the rights to the gulfstream pipeline project from coastal divestment of this asset was required i understand as part of the el paso coastal merger this situation gives added impetus to development of the cypress pipeline project by enron and el paso there is considerable merit in enron retaining the right to market its own gas out of the elba island lng terminal however we may find it desirable to reach some commercial resolution with el paso merchant energy for a portion of our volumes that also makes the quality issue disappear however should we decide to so compromise we must either fully engage southern lng in that solution or totally eliminate them from all aspects of our agreement with el paso in the case of southern lng we are dealing with one or more individuals who see only one way to do things namely their way and who are totally opposed to working with enron i would recommend any compromise with el paso merchant energy be conditioned on first reaching agreement with southern lng on explicit terms acceptable to us and checking it twice i would appreciate receiving your comments if any before thanksgiving regards les webber,0

my message cut off the conclusion is that while we continue to need to address the kinds of issues laid out in your recommnedations we need to look at solutions which may go deeper to adress our communications problems solutions which have become available only recently why not have these guys focus on an online training program to both teach people how to make information available and accessible eg by recording information and updating on the intranet and demonstrating the importance of this activity to the success of the organization i think you and your team have done a fine job dealing with the traditional and perhaps largely insoluble problems that this group wants to take on i am pessimistic that the program outlined below will provide anything other than marginal improvements i am somewhat optimistic though that we may be able to bypass many of these problems and get to the heart of what people are really complaining about in the survey by instituting real

greetings from the land of watery eyed flat assed office workers how goes the burly mountain man thing i ve been hearing second hand from elliot that you re faring extremely well mentally despite some poorly crafted sleeping bags and a bad case of frostbite on your toes that second part i made up but it sounded appropriate given the sleeping bag situation all s well here as you could imagine and probably often do the sweeping expanse of people staring at computers that is enron has changed not at all since you left there are still many computers many of them have changed positions some have gone away most we are not sad to see go that s just the nature of this cutthroat business also on the stagnantly invariable list is the status of my life in relation to enron i am still here i still stare at the computer every once in awhile i meander over to the dark window less corner that enshrouds the it wizards and ask them silly questions like what does it mean when i hit this button and my screen starts flashing at me like a disco ball then makes this awkward shrieking noise and finally goes black they are incredibly helpful i am still pretty much clueless about most things although i ve learned to talk about them with a semblance of authority as in no you twit the megawatt off peak deal should clearly be flowing across sp to np because of the illiquidity of sp s market right now what kind of idiot wouldn t hedge their position in california at a time like this it all sounds very exotic and important to me which is why i m still here but i m infinitely jealous of your wild exploits in the great american outdoors i suspect my forbearance for sitting in an office will run out right around the middle of the summer so i m planning a trip to coincide with that meltdown i haven t decided between a road trip through the western united states or just a direct flight to paris both sound good and way beyond my budget therefore equally attractive well i ve managed to say practically nothing for long enough now i do hope you re having an amazing time rambling on toward the next crazy adventure on the horizon as i believe jack kerouac once wrote we re all very proud of you here and constantly refer to you as my good friend winston who s skiing across the state of wyoming which was my idea i d love to hear about your trip direct from the source although i know you re extremely busy out there skiing and killing wild animals for sustenance and whatnot but please do write back if you can still move your fingers sincerely kate the slightly ditsy one who sits in the middle of the room and tries to look constantly busy,0

having our hispanic community come out in force for issues like this it empowers us said celina garza ridge a harris county houston sports authority director it s very important to be able to say the hispanic community made a difference and we are exactly in that position george postolos the houston rockets chief operating officer said the team is actively courting the hispanic community the pro arena committee headed by former reliant energy chairman don jordan and ken lay enron chairman and chief executive officer does not want a repeat of the referendum voters last november soundly

cost mln by bryan lee  dow jones energy service copyright c dow jones company inc of dow jones newswires washington dow jones the nation s top two power providers are battling in a u s court over an unexecuted power sales agreement the tennessee valley authority tva has filed a claim against the power marketing unit of enron corp ene alleging breach of a power sales contract tva cited the alleged breach of contract in documents provided to its distribution utility customers earlier this month outlining unforeseen expenses contributing to the government owned utility s inability to meet its debt reduction forecast according to the documents obtained by dow jones newswires the alleged breach of contract contributed to a million shortfall during fiscal year  tva was initially reluctant to divulge information on the case which is under a court protective order a major power provider elected not to perform under the contract said david smith tva s chief financial officer when asked friday to elaborate on the line item in the information provided to tva s distribution utility customers but after consulting with attorneys smith revealed that enron was the subject of the claim tva alleged breach of contract after enron sought a declaratory judgment order from the u s district court in chattanooga tenn in february stemming from a dispute over a long term sales agreement an enron spokesman said monday in march tva filed a counter claim with the court alleging breach of contract a tva spokesman said monday but the two parties declined to discuss the terms of the contract or to elaborate further on the dispute citing the judge s protective order tva said enron sought the court seal the dispute is the latest example of bad blood between the houston based energy giant and tva a government owned utility that ranks among the largest u s power producers the relationship deteriorated after the two began squabbling over access to the lucrative u s midwest power market which saw extreme price spikes during hot weather in the summers of and after the summer of in which power that typically sells for between and per megawatt hour spiked as high as per megawatt hour enron cited a study showing that tva s power grid represented the only unconstrained transmission pathways into the midwest tva experienced an increase in revenues for the period when power prices were spiking upward enron built gas fired peaking power plants with an eye toward capitalizing on the volatility in summer power markets by purchasing transmission access across tva s system after the summer of saw a repeat in extreme price volatility enron began complaining that tva was unfairly denying transmission service by failing to act in a timely manner in response to transmission service requests a tva spokesman said the contract dispute was unrelated to the disagreement over the government utility s handling of transmission access requests but the filing of the court case occurred at the same time enron went public with its complaints about tva s transmission service in february enron released a letter to energy secretary bill richardson asking for the government s help charging that tva was unfairly giving its own power marketer transmission service on a timely basis while enron s requests were gathering dust enron later dropped the matter saying that tva was processing its transmission service requests on a timely basis by bryan lee dow jones newswires bryan lee dowjones com copyright dow jones company inc all rights reserved,0

the following report is comprised of what was discussed at the commission meeting held tonight at approximately pm est and additional intelligence gathered from ferc staffers after the meeting by joe hartsoe physical withholding to prevent physical withholding the plan will require sellers with pga s to offer all their available power in real time all california generators even those not subject to ferc price regulation will be required to sell into the iso s real time market as a condition of their use of the iso s interstate transmission lines hydroelectric facilities will be exempted for yr price mitigation the plan will establish a single market clearing price auction for the real time market during stage and emergencies in the iso s real time market each generator other than hydro with a participating generator agreement is required to offer all available power and bid its marginal cost based on the generator s heat curve emission rates gas costs and emission costs plus for o m the gas cost will be the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in california emissions are to be based on cammon fitzgerald the gas cost and emissions will be published the day after for use on the following day a single market clearing price is determined in real time for all generators highest bid sets the clearing price each gas fired generator must file with ferc and the iso on a confidential basis heat and emission rates for each generating unit the iso will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost for each generator including maintenance and operating costs in the event a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price the generator must within days of the end of each month file a report with ferc and the iso justifying its price ferc has days to review act no opportunity costs in real time marketers are in the same boat as they must be prepared to justify bid at purchased cost based on specific purchases or portfolio with no opportunity cost however credit sleeves are permissible demand response beginning june only public utility load serving entities must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to be curtailed under those bids ferc is attempting to break the demand curve  outages pga generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced outages in accordance with the commission staff proposal adopted by ferc term order expires one year from date of issuance rto filing california iso and two utilities must make rto filing by june or order lapses with no further effect iso reporting on september iso must file a status report on how things are working and how much generation has been built comments are due in days quarterly reports thereafter revocation of market based rate authority and refunds the market based rate authority of all public utilities is conditioned on no physical withhold of capacity and no inappropriate bidding behavior inappropriate bidding behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit behavior an increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be inappropriate in addition hockey stick bids are expressly prohibited i e bidding at marginal cost and at a much higher level limited filing applies to sales in the wscc outside california refund conditions apply in real time spot markets when contingency within a control area falls below control areas are not required to publish when this condition occurs apparently anything over marginal cost must be justified all marketers and non hydroelectric generators must offer to sell contractually and physically available capacity energy to a location within wscc ferc is attempting to mirror the rules applied in california comments are due in days on the investigations the refund effective date is days from publication of the order nox limits in california must sell requirements do not apply if a unit is prohibited from running by law however it appears that incurring fines does not overcome the must sell requirement just include the fines as part of the price bid also if nox is limited may seek to show that generation would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining price surcharge to pay past amount due comments are due in days on whether ferc should require the iso to surcharge parties for payment into an escrow account to pay past costs and the effect this surcharge would have on the pg e bankruptcy filing no mention was made at the meeting as to issue of exports of power from california the order is not finally drafted as of yet and the status of the foregoing items could change upon issuance of the final order we will keep you posted ra,0

houstonstreet exchange and true quote llc and industry sources confirm that enrononline is negotiating similar deals with several other exchanges including houston based altra energy technologies and

exchange industry insiders describe it as simply an online extension of enron s business but in enrononline s first six months of operation after being launched last november the value of transactions conducted on the system surpassed billion at a rate of billion a day the platform offers trading in a wide variety of commodities from most forms of energy to bandwidth and paper more eyeballs the agreements enrononline has struck will enable the company to post the prices at which it will buy or sell natural gas and electricity on housonstreet com and truequote com neither houstonstreet nor truequote prices however will appear on enrononline customers on those two sites who click on an enron quote will be instantly linked to enrononline where the trades will take place as louise kitchen president of enrononline said extending their pricing to more eyeballs will build more transaction volume for enron says paul bourke president of altra the question is whether it will build volume for the other exchanges we are talking to enron bourke adds we are intrigued and we are attempting understand what the business benefits to altra would be he says an enron altra deal would be more complicated than those involving other exchanges because of altra s significant liquidity in natural gas altra is the leader in online natural gas trading while none of the exchanges would reveal what if any financial terms are involved in the agreements other than to say there is no sharing of commissions bourke says he expects that if altra and enron finalize an agreement enron would take a small equity position in altra he speculates that this is what enron did with houstonstreet brian pieri vice president of red meteor says the value of enrononline to the other exchanges is that they bring tight bid offers which is something the exchanges have to work hard on and more people will make the bid offers even tighter this means buy and sell prices are close together which helps market liquidity asked if the additional liquidity and trading volume that enron might bring to the other exchanges wouldn t just further fragment the market pieri compared the whole online trading scene to a sixth grade dance the boys are all on one side of the room and the girls are on the other side and nobody is dancing somebody has to start and then everybody else joins in enron brings more validity to this very new situation pied says all of the exchanges are trying to build liquidity of which enron is the king says bill swanton an analyst with amr research swanton predicts that the energy exchanges will consolidate within the next six to eight months and the ultimate surviving exchanges will not be owned by any single player you need an independent exchange i can t imagine enron will end up running it the trading community won t be satisfied with that he says swanton points out however that enron will attract attention they don t want if they force some of these guys out of business but houstonstreet s ceo frank getman takes a different view of what the enron deals mean web based energy trading exchanges are no longer about liquidity thanks to these enrononline data

for the record i have read judge biren s ruling and contrary to what people might have said in the conference call on friday it is silent on the topics of the testimony schedule and the presentation of arguments the three sentence e mail from biren simply requests that the parties attend the phc at which time she will rule on the motion and states that she might issue a further ruling prior to the phc i think it is probably fair to expect she may solicit brief comments from representatives of the parties at the phc jeffery fawcett pm to steven harris et s enron enron kevin hyatt et s enron enron susan scott et s enron enron jeff dasovich sfo ees ees mbaldwin igservice com tim aron et s enron enron julia white et s enron enron cc subject socal gir settlement telecon i participated in a teleconference today at p m with several members of the all party settlement group the alj assigned to the gir case andrea biren has apparently issued a ruling on socal s motion to extend the deadline for filing the all party settlement although i personally haven t seen the document yet it was the primary focus of the meeting according to accounts from the group judge biren s ruling did not grant socal s motion for extension rather she will hear arguments on the motion during the prehearing conference scheduled for tuesday april judge biren also asked that parties to the proceeding be prepared to file full scale testimony discussing all settlement proposals on file as well as offer any addtional comments on the most promising options set forth by the commission unfortunately she is silent on what date the testimony would be due originally testimony was due on april in addition judge biren s ruling apparently leaves open the possibility that she could be talked into something different during tuesday s prehearing conference ie a different procedural schedule or an amended or streamlined testimony filing protocol the telecon group decided to do the following approach cpuc commissioner bilas on monday and let him know the status of the all party settlement and ask him to intervene in favor of the extension go before judge biren on tuesday as a group and individually if necessary and request that in leiu of a full scale testimony procedure would she accept a process whereby similar to what was done in the pg e settlement parties file declarations in favor of one settlement versus another and then the judge supervises conducts a panel discussion on the issues surrounding the settlement if judge biren rejects the idea of a less formal process one which arguably doesn t offer as complete a record in the case which most on the call felt was the likely outcome then would she agree to a schedule whereby she grants the socal motion the all party settlement is filed on april then all parties including the norm pedersen group would have the chance to file testimony only testimony not additional declarations indicating support of one settlement over another and the reasons logic including how the settlements meet the commisision objectives on or before may as far as the all party settlement document is concerned socal will be forwarding a preliminary as yet incomplete draft for the parties to review but not to comment on socal intends to circulate another more complete version monday morning for purposes of soliciting comments changes as far as transwestern is concerned i ve spoken independently with the team susan mark and jeff dasovich each of us will review and provide tw comments to socal regarding the settlement document susan will be representing tw at the prehearing conference on tuesday mark baldwin will be there also to support susan s efforts on tuesday susan and jeff and maybe mark will try and hook up tuesday morning to compare notes and talk about the upcoming commission phc steve between susan and i we ll continue to forward documentation and other materials regarding this case as well as to provide you with our comments and or any drafts of testimony tw intends to file in this case,0

here is the draft letter agreement we are still discussing it with ecs and can make whatever changes are appropriate note that the letter agreement ties back to article of the compression services agreement that article you may recall is where ecs agreed to create a computerized system that would monitor continental divide s electric system utilization and warn when their system peaks were occurring and then automatically take the compressor offline subject to manual override so we and ecs could avoid peak period demand charges instead of creating such a system which apparently turned out to be mostly a manual system anyway ecs is going to pay us a monthly fee to monitor cd s system peaks ourselves and decide when we need to get off line the load management service has to do with operational management of the load we place on cd s electric system and is not a jurisdictional gas transportation or storage service note that the service goes on for years as required by the accountants year amortization rule and thus may be vulnerable to scrutiny and potential revenue crediting in tw s rate case any way to avoid that df,0

lindy fyi this is just really informal so i d prefer you not forward to anyone yet drew and maria are most familiar with this so i m going to get their feedback first before setting up a meeting i ll get with you before i set a meeting time to see when you re available forwarded by susan scott et s enron on pm susan scott pm to drew fossum enron maria pavlou et s enron enron cc subject recourse rate dilemma the sequel maria and drew this is a long winded e mail but please bear with me the problem as you probably remember several months ago several of us met to discuss the following language in the rofr portion of transwestern s tariff if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate then the rate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate and the additional frustrating language a ll available capacity shall be allocated under these procedures at our last meeting we concluded that probably the best way to ensure that tw could capture the true value of the capacity would be to link the negotiated rate to index prices however since this usually involves an unacceptable amount of risk to both the shipper and tw the marketers haven t done any index based rates and have no current plans to enter into any such deals i have been asked by the commercial group to revisit this issue and to think of other ways we could increase our ability to charge more than the maximum rate ideally they would like to eliminate the language i ve quoted above however my research has indicated that absent our bringing about radical change in the way ferc thinks about recourse rates or showing that tw lacks market power we are probably stuck with this language why the problem exists you may already know steve stojic and i did some looking into why the language is in our tariff in the first place in the alternative rates policy statement rm the commission explained that it is willing to entertain individual requests for negotiated rates but only where customers retain the ability to choose a cost of service based tariff rates t he availability of a recourse service would prevent pipelines from exercising market power by assuring that the customer can fall back to cost based traditional service if the pipeline unilaterally demands excessive prices or withholds service thus the recourse rate mitigates market power the commission went on to confirmed that under rofr provisions the highest rate that an existing shipper must match if it wishes to continue its transportation arrangement is the maximum tariff rate this policy is clearly not limited to rofr situations when capacity is constrained a shipper willing to pay only the recourse rate cannot lose access to capacity merely because someone else is willing to pay a negotiated rate when there are more requests for capacity than there is capacity available then the pipeline must allocate capacity among those shippers willing to pay either the negotiated rate or the maximum recourse rate for example on a pro rata basis if required by its tariff the example cited by the commission if a pipeline has dth d available and two shippers request that capacity one who is willing to pay no more than the recourse rate of and another a negotiated rate of then each would be allocated dth d on a pro rata basis assuming the tariff provided for pro rata allocation and not some other allocation method such as lottery when tw filed for authority to charge negotiated rates it voluntarily added the statement that if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate then the rate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate presumably we had concluded that we needed to add this recourse rate related provision in order to receive negotiated rate authority solutions i would like to know whether you concur that changing our tariff language outright is probably out of the question i feel as if i ve really been chasing my tail here i have owed lindy an answer for some time now but i keep coming back to our having to prove lack of market power which drew is where i believe you were headed when we talked about this in mid october steve harris has asked whether we can just start small and remove the recourse rate cap as to only a portion of our system i think we would still have to show lack of market power in order to do this do you agree stojic warns that proving lack of market power is a lengthy and expensive proposition might be worth it to us though another idea is to somehow provide shippers with an incentive to pay more than max rate after all we do have authority to charge negotiated rates we ve seen one instance in which one of our marketers was able to get more than max rates for it space based on good customer relations alone however despite our wonderful relationships with most of our customers it s unlikely we can pull this off with any consistency we wondered whether we might be able to get more than max rates in the context of an auction procedure but i just am not convinced we could get around the commission s requirement that recourse rates be available that requirement has not changed have either of you seen anything to the contrary i would like to meet with you two plus several others i have in mind to discuss this preferably early this week tues or wed but would like to discuss briefly with you first please call me so we can talk for a few minutes thanks,0

ees group cc john sherriff lon ect ect michael r brown lon ect ect david w delainey hou ect ect janet r dietrich hou ect ect dan leff hou ees ees marty sunde hou ees ees richard lewis lon ect ect subject ees europe outsourcing reorganisation introduction ees has been operating in europe since late and in that time a lot of progress has been made the teams who have worked on outsourcing in europe have learnt a tremendous amount over the last year we now have a much clearer idea of what should work today in the different jurisdictions that comprise europe and those elements of our offering with which customers are most comfortable the phenomenally strong financial performance in of enron direct and etol graphically demonstrate the future potential in europe for a broad retail energy business with enron s retail energy presence in europe firmly established we are restructuring our outsourcing product offering and the organisation to develop and deliver it so that we broaden our activities and successfully grow our earnings in line with shareholder expectations we now have a renewed focus in the emphasis will be to work on only the largest deals by energy commodity spend in those markets where we already have a robust wholesale energy business and there is regulated and economic third party access to retail power distribution systems the main thrust of our offering will be commodity and demand side management dsm projects and our associated price risk management capabilities commodity is enron s core competence and one where enron should be in a position to generate sizeable gross margin at closure dsm projects are also important as they will deliver gross margin and are what differentiate us from the commodity competition we will be focussing on shorter project lead times at the front of a deal to ensure that we get to closure promptly we need to see of the value in of the time whilst we retain an understanding of o m this will not form part of our core offering and we will only consider involvement in an o m capacity on attractive margin transactions where it is essential to the customer as the business develops it is likely that to some extent we will build the necessary o m delivery capability to enhance the product offering in the future in those markets where we have limited wholesale capability or the third party access to power distribution systems is not feasible in a retail context we will build and develop utility representation services urs in conjunction with a dsm project offering this knowledge based business will allow us to develop retail customer networks in advance of economic system access and also provide valuable market information back to the wholesale business urs is erpag s core business and gives us a tremendous platform to create a pan european urs competence expertise in supply side management has increasingly become an issue for the origination team in ees europe as we have begun to get into material deal development whilst it is vital that we remain totally coordinated with the wholesale business for price risk management services there will be a renewed emphasis within ees europe to develop those commodity skills that do not reside in the wholesale business to allow us to promptly and effectively price and structure retail commodity transactions to the delivery point given the renewed focus outlined above we have taken the opportunity to streamline the account delivery and management team typically redeploying staff where they can immediately support the development of new business for ees europe effective account management remains a key capability for ees and as we close deals with customers we will review our staffing need in this area organisation after eighteen months working on establishing the outsourcing business in europe ron bertasi has decided to transition back to the us during the first half of in the short term he will complete the trillium property deal and ensure that the energy and property deals are both successfully launched i would like to take this opportunity to thank ron on behalf of everyone in europe for all his hard work over the last eighteen months in establishing the european outsourcing business and in particular his leadership on the trillium deal which represents a substantial landmark for the business stuart rexrode is now head of european energy services outsourcing stuart will continue in a customer facing capacity as a lead originator whilst ensuring that all of the dimensions that comprise the outsourcing team remain appropriately focussed bob manasse will head up the origination team and ensure that the deal pipeline remains full of substantial good quality prospects hala tayyarah has been promoted to manager within the commodity team and will provide commodity pricing support to the origination team hala will report to peter redpath until such time as a head of supply side management is appointed reporting to peter redpath peter ramgolam will lead a new activity transaction economics supporting origination by developing cashflow models to determine deal economics identify improvements to structures to optimise value and capture transactions for risk management purposes also reporting to peter redpath john parker will lead the implementation of a position management activity the attached organisation charts show these changes in the revised structure of ees europe which is effective immediately whilst these charts are relatively self explanatory for the levels shown there will be detailed discussions over the next day or so to explain what the changes mean for individuals where boxes are labelled tba we hope to make appointments in the near future at am on monday th february we shall be holding a one hour ees europe all employee meeting in the auditorium in place of the usual weekly staff meeting at this session we will talk about the earnings plan and provide clarity on the deal process for outsourcing and the reasoning behind it also it will be an opportunity for you to raise any questions you may have i look forward to seeing you there matthew,0

thanks for sending me your thoughts from the meeting you attended these are interesting and definitely can relate to some of the things that we discussed in dallas please continue to send me any thoughts you have on the subject i will organize a recap of the recent work we have done in trying to size the market for our services and get that out to all attendees within the next week or so sally richard sage am to sally beck hou ect ect cc subject fyi stp and t sally i went to a seminar on monday evening organised by a consultancy called the capital markets company who did the market analysis on the t idea for the global stp association attendees were ubs warburg goldman sachs morgan stanley depository trust company etc the subject was nominally how moving to t settlement in the financial markets would affect stp but it ended up going rather wider than that there were distinct echoes of some of the discussions at the ase in dallas so i thought you might be interested to see some of the thoughts expressed it seemed that every bank was hoping to be able to sell the back office services but no one seemed to be willing to buy some people would only ever buy if there was more than one supplier so that there was a competitive market somebody will eventually break through to be able to offer the services one cannot avoid having to understand processes by outsourcing one needs to understand the process in order to police the sla support personnel perceive that it will probably be years before it becomes so difficult to make more more in the front office that there will be serious focus on saving money in the back office nobody s compensation is realistically tied to achieving operational metrics nothing will change until there is a crisis t would just increase the number of fails this might be the crisis which would drive out the weaker players which would mean that the remaining players would be only dealing with better organised counterparties which would decrease the number of fails this last point prompts the thought that the quickest way to generate lots of demand for eeo services from outside would be to have the standard cycle times reduced have ferc insist but we would have to make sure we could cope to,0

jose i think the supplemental info you have provided is outstanding and helpful to the lenders in understanding the overall picture and the history however its focus is not the central concern of the lenders at this point as i understand it the lenders and their counsel are concerned specifically about third party liability meaning i believe lawsuits or claims from parties who did not receive power because cuiaba failed to generate therefore i think the questions which tozzinni needs to address are along the lines of if epe is required to sign the agreements by aneel what is the extent of damages that could be claimed in the context of such agreements could any consequential damages be assessed could epe excuse itself from the legal proceedings on the basis of the bid documents the ppa or other agreements with furnas electronote or eletrabras how would the economic equilibrium process work in the case of a judgement which was payable by epe could the process be expedited to avert a liquidity crisis could epe be denied access to the grid as a result of failure to cover a spot market price assessed by the mae stemming from an unscheduled outage similarly could epe incur penalties or be denied transmission if they failed to contribute in accordance with the shared liability provisions of the agreements will we need to sign the agreements for other reasons such as access to back up power which would be excluded from the protections by furnas under the ppa could furnas deny or delay reimbursement if the amount is not recoverable by them or while they are awaiting word on a claims recoverability a question for insurance does our business interuption insurance protect us in any of these instances note the us mm sponsor liquidity facility provides some comfort to the lenders john stop me if you think i am off track if you have other questions which you think need to be addressed please continue,0

news over the past few months we ve been evaluating other service  providers to find out if it would be in enron s best interests both financially and from a service point of view to change registered agents  we met with the litigation unit to ensure that service of process needs wou ld be met and hopefully exceeded and we talked with representatives of enro n tax departments re online information designed to assist the tax preparatio n procedures we tested all aspects of the proposed services to our satisfaction and we worked assiduously with the successful candidate to ensure enron user friendly websites we anticipate that there will be a saving to enron of approximately per year which will be passed directly to your cost centers after much kicking of the tyres we re terminating our relationship with ct corporation system in favor of nationa l registered agents inc nrai nrai will prepare file and absorb all  costs associated with the change of registered agent we anticipate that t he majority of delaware change of registered agent filings will be effective b y the end of january but be aware that some other states take several months to handle filings the database will reflect the change of registered agent as  we receive evidence of filings as part of the process a free status check  will determine the good standing of all enron entities we ll be happy to  pass these good standing certificates on to the relevant tax departments ct corporation will remain as agent for those historical entities that were  voluntarily dissolved or withdrawn and for contracts or agreements where c t corporation was named as registered agent for service of process unless legal counsel decides to amend the terms nrai a new jersey based company was formed years ago by ex

maria and drew this is a long winded e mail but please bear with me the problem as you probably remember several months ago several of us met to discuss the following language in the rofr portion of transwestern s tariff if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate then the rate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate and the additional frustrating language a ll available capacity shall be allocated under these procedures at our last meeting we concluded that probably the best way to ensure that tw could capture the true value of the capacity would be to link the negotiated rate to index prices however since this usually involves an unacceptable amount of risk to both the shipper and tw the marketers haven t done any index based rates and have no current plans to enter into any such deals i have been asked by the commercial group to revisit this issue and to think of other ways we could increase our ability to charge more than the maximum rate ideally they would like to eliminate the language i ve quoted above however my research has indicated that absent our bringing about radical change in the way ferc thinks about recourse rates or showing that tw lacks market power we are probably stuck with this language why the problem exists you may already know steve stojic and i did some looking into why the language is in our tariff in the first place in the alternative rates policy statement rm the commission explained that it is willing to entertain individual requests for negotiated rates but only where customers retain the ability to choose a cost of service based tariff rates t he availability of a recourse service would prevent pipelines from exercising market power by assuring that the customer can fall back to cost based traditional service if the pipeline unilaterally demands excessive prices or withholds service thus the recourse rate mitigates market power the commission went on to confirmed that under rofr provisions the highest rate that an existing shipper must match if it wishes to continue its transportation arrangement is the maximum tariff rate this policy is clearly not limited to rofr situations when capacity is constrained a shipper willing to pay only the recourse rate cannot lose access to capacity merely because someone else is willing to pay a negotiated rate when there are more requests for capacity than there is capacity available then the pipeline must allocate capacity among those shippers willing to pay either the negotiated rate or the maximum recourse rate for example on a pro rata basis if required by its tariff the example cited by the commission if a pipeline has dth d available and two shippers request that capacity one who is willing to pay no more than the recourse rate of and another a negotiated rate of then each would be allocated dth d on a pro rata basis assuming the tariff provided for pro rata allocation and not some other allocation method such as lottery when tw filed for authority to charge negotiated rates it voluntarily added the statement that if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate then the rate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate presumably we had concluded that we needed to add this recourse rate related provision in order to receive negotiated rate authority solutions i would like to know whether you concur that changing our tariff language outright is probably out of the question i feel as if i ve really been chasing my tail here i have owed lindy an answer for some time now but i keep coming back to our having to prove lack of market power which drew is where i believe you were headed when we talked about this in mid october steve harris has asked whether we can just start small and remove the recourse rate cap as to only a portion of our system i think we would still have to show lack of market power in order to do this do you agree stojic warns that proving lack of market power is a lengthy and expensive proposition might be worth it to us though another idea is to somehow provide shippers with an incentive to pay more than max rate after all we do have authority to charge negotiated rates we ve seen one instance in which one of our marketers was able to get more than max rates for it space based on good customer relations alone however despite our wonderful relationships with most of our customers it s unlikely we can pull this off with any consistency we wondered whether we might be able to get more than max rates in the context of an auction procedure but i just am not convinced we could get around the commission s requirement that recourse rates be available that requirement has not changed have either of you seen anything to the contrary i would like to meet with you two plus several others i have in mind to discuss this preferably early this week tues or wed but would like to discuss briefly with you first please call me so we can talk for a few minutes thanks,0

shelf lands act governing the movement of natural gas on facilities on the outer continental shelf rm the final rule is attached pages executive summary the final rule was issued april and becomes effective days after publication in the federal register the purpose of the final rule is to establish a data base as a foundation for identifying discrimination with ocs gas service providers the reporting will include affiliations and conditions of service this is a procedural rule reporting only the rule only applies to gas pipelines ferc found transportation for oil pipelines to be just and reasonable the commission is acting in part as a response to the ruling in sea robin in which the court directed ferc to reconsider the manner in which it applied its primary function test to sea robin s predominantly offshore system nopr was issued on june the commission believes that the new ocsla reporting requirements mirror certain existing nga reporting requirements salient points of the final rule are exemptions service providers that confine their operations to moving their own gas or that of a single shipper are exempt from reporting add new section a and note reporting exemption turns on identity of service provider and its shippers not type of service provided gas service providers that are regulated by ferc under nga are exempt from ocsla reporting add new section a exempts lines that feed into a facility where gas is first collected separated dehydrated or processed from ocsla reporting requirements add new section a reporting requirements if an nga regulated company s system includes ocs facilities that are not subject to nga gathering production lines the company must submit an ocsla report covering its non nga facilities reclassified facilities will no longer be subject to nga reporting requirements but will be subject to ocsla requirements shippers no longer have protection against the exercise of market power afforded by the nga service provider must list all of its affiliates defined as engaged in the exploration development production processing transportation marketing consumption or sale of gas need be identified in the report new section a reporting updates restricted to four times per year reports will be based on conditions on the first day of the first full calendar quarter that begins after the effective date of this rule reports due on the first business day after the close of the quarter providers will have more than one full quarter in which to prepare their initial oscla report providers will be required to submit a description of their operations as they stand on the first day of each calendar quarter e g describing the provider s status on one particular day report due on first business day of the subsequent

midam advised us they intend to call the enforcement hotline probably today to get enforcement staff involved in resolving the carlton timing problem i e the absence of an order approving or not approving the settlement if midam does so enforcement will then contact northern for a response probably dari or mkm or i but who knows who they ll call if they do the following bullets are important to convey as our preliminary response to midam midam and all of our customers are aware that a commission order on the june settlement is necessary before the precise flow obligation for this nov march period can be determined the flow obligation for sourcers like midam will be slightly higher by about if the settlement is approved for all customers that have asked what the precise flow obligation numbers would be under the two scenarios settlement approval or settlement non approval we have given that information we gave that information to midam also we can t file the tariff sheets setting out the specific number for this heating season until the commission addresses the settlement the true financial impact of the current uncertainty on midam is minimal we believe many of the sourcers have locked in their supply based on the lower flow obligation number but with an option to increase their purchase quantity if the commission approves the settlement midam may have done that but we don t know if not and if the commission approves the settlement their only real cost would arise if they have to buy the additional flow obligation volume about mmbtu d for midam now at a higher price than they would have paid if they bought it earlier when they locked up the bulk of their flow obligation supply given the large drop in gas prices the last several days there may not be any increased cost the bottom line is that we really need an order on the settlement the majority of northern s customers support it as a fair solution to the carlton problem midam is the only opponent that has raised substantive issues midam is clinging to a financial windfall it gets under the old carlton mechanism and has no reason to oppose the settlement other than preserving that windfall that s the end of the proposed script the last bullet may go to far but i like it frank and steve mkm suggested that you guys get doering and gorak and others to call ferc hotline or otherwise i don t think it matters and express their concern that the order is not on the agenda df,0

with pma s volumes can be adjusted through the system as usual and i can adjust the demand fee on the sitara ticket i am not able to follow your ua calculation however there was imbalance payback that occurred throughout september and october this should have been pathed to the lone star transport k in unify is this in that ua number williams had been trying to make up volumes from prior periods so that s probably why their volume came in greater than booked much of their gas is from el paso and volumes vary each day from scheduled the volumes that they were trying to make up would go toward the transport imbalance also i would think that cleburne will carry an imbalance on lone star from month to month after novemeber the imbalance should be fairly small our scheduler mark mccoy will have that number when we took over this deal the imbalance on lone star was very large when the plant went down in sep we decided to payback the imbalance then so that we could take advantage of higher winter sales prices if the opportunity came up the agreement does not specifically state anything about ua but i will discuss that with legal the intent is for all costs including ua and fuel to be covered by tenaska iv i will be leaving at pm today and will return on tuesday we can get together then if you would like d from jim pond enron am to daren j farmer hou ect ect cc greg whiting corp enron enron ect troy klussmann hou ect ect james armstrong hou ect ect megan parker corp enron enron ect subject re tenaska iv darren the demand fee is probably the best solution we can use it to create a recieivable payable with tenaska depending on which way the calculation goes each month how are pma s to be handled once the fee been calculated and the deal put in the system attatched is a schedule detailing what is on the gl for cleburne as of today some of this info will change by the end of the month as you can see there are some discrepancies between megan s calculations and what is on the general ledger ua is also on my schedule unless the buys sells are volumetrically balanced we book an entry to balance the desk this will change the calculation of what is due from to tenaska should we be recording a ua entry for cleburne is it addressed in the agreement with tenaska daren j farmer ect pm to greg whiting corp enron enron troy klussmann hou ect ect james armstrong hou ect ect megan parker corp enron enron jim pond corp enron enron cc subject tenaska iv in most cases ena will be a net buyer from tenaska iv for activity related to the cleburne plant however for october the plant was down the majority of the month and ena sold off the supply resulting in ena owing money to tenaska iv i have created deal with a demand of which is the calculated amount of income on the cleburne desk please see the attached schedule we need to pass this income on to tenaska iv do we need to pay this amount wire from ena to tenaska iv or is there another way to do this this is the case for october and could possibly happen again in the future greg troy jim please let me know what you think about settling this megan don t pay the amount until we here from the greg troy and jim also make sure that we have received dollars from the spot sales before we reimburse tenaska iv d forwarded by daren j farmer hou ect on pm enron north america corp from megan parker enron am to daren j farmer hou ect ect cc subject tenaska iv we have actuals the larger of the two volumes is which is day so the demand rate in deal is fine i am having a problem though with the way it is coming to settlements it is showing up with a jan delivery date i think the demand fee needs to be on only right now it is on a line with a date of to i think this is confusing the system some how also we still need the purchase deal for tenaska iv it should be for a demand fee of booked to the cleburne desk we actually owe but i need to net the tenaska iv sales with the purchase to clear those receivables james is calling me every day asking for an update do you know when we will be able to get this in the system i have attached my spreadsheet so you can see the numbers megan,0

fyi don t know what happened to my recommendation that they use either an unexecuted agreement notation or call the counterparty from the trading floor on a recorded line forwarded by dan j hyvl hou ect on pm  julie meyers pm to melissa graves hou ect ect cc kathryn cordes hou ect ect donald p reinhardt hou ect ect susan smith hou ect ect vance l taylor hou ect ect dan j hyvl hou ect ect subject re gtc s and confirms re i don t believe that the traders on are appropriately covered based on what dan has told me is that a concern if so it is possible to manually change the confirm to fit the situation for the mean time re i understand what mary is saying but in these cases that i m referring to which i believe are rare i believe the gas is flowing the meter has been turned on and isn t the pipeline accepting the gas we are still not nominating the gas and because we have not put the ticket into the system we are withholding payment now from what i understand client services will make a manual payment if they are called by the producer but for month or even months we have not made a payment because client services would not have known to make a payment therefore we are still in violation it appears the best solution legally would be not to turn on the meter until the contract is signed i m not sure that is a good business decission though i know that there are cases where we don t know that the meter is still flowing or that it has been turned on i think the easiest thing would be to make sure that we are covered with a gtc spot taking out the language of the recorded line julie enron capital trade resources corp from melissa graves am to julie meyers hou ect ect cc kathryn cordes hou ect ect donald p reinhardt hou ect ect susan smith hou ect ect vance l taylor hou ect ect subject re gtc s and confirms julie in response to your concerns below the traders on are currently attempting to install a recorded line to be used when negotiating the difficulty with putting in a contract as unexecuted is that unify will not prevent the payment from going out the door i do not believe unify settlements drafts based on contract status it drafts on any sitara deal that replicated down and sitara reads unexecuted as a valid contract we have posed the possibility of entering the contract as unexecuted and enhancing unify to hold payment as long as there was vp approval to hold payment but mary cook said that this process would be in violation of the ucc based on the fact that we would partially perform by accepting the gas via the nom scheduling process with this partial performance withholding the payment would not be appropriate under the law please let me know your thoughts after reviewing my comments thank you melissa julie meyers pm to melissa graves hou ect ect cc kathryn cordes hou ect ect subject gtc s and confirms while going through our confirmation process there was some concern raised on deals that we are not confirming i m sure you are aware of the concern that george w had with not wanting a confirmation to go out to the producers when they were trying to get a firm contract signed i spoke with dan hyvl today and i wanted to relay to you his thoughts his first concern was if the asset traders were trading on a recorded phone lines apparently the gtc s specify that if there is a dispute with what is on the confirmation the recorded phone call would be the back up he said that if these calls are not recorded then we should not be using the gtc s in the case where the tickets are being held back until the contract is signed example a ticket was submitted today to start back in june then we should be putting the contract in as unexecuted so the deal can be valued and tracked his decision on that issue was based on my memory that if a contract is marked unexecuted unify would not make payment if that is not the case we could still put the contract and deal in the systems and have a vp signed off that payment would not go out the door if deals are being done on an unrecorded phone line dan said that we would need to do something different if the payment is to go out the door like for example have the producer sign a one month contract which i m not sure you would want to do that otherwise he said that the trades should be sent down to so they will be recorded i hope this makes sense please call me and let me know your thoughts julie,0

bob per your request here is the rundown on patti s activities for august and beyond we calculated the amount we made on her experience in handling el paso s transport to be close to million month i could not even begin to calculate the amount made just by having her here if patti had just quit with everyone else gone the amount lost on el paso would be huge including loss of credibility on our part with our customers the exact amount would be close to million month i would think the spreads out west have been huge this summer we were able to take advantage of this because patti was here to do the scheduling during a very difficult time when i was out for the entire month of august patti was not only holding down a desk that usually three people handle but was also filling in on management duties patti worked weeks in a row including weekends without taking a day off she worked at least hours a day during this time handling several different jobs at a time the exact value of what patti did is hard to determine i would estimate that her presence here and stepping in to help out was woth about million to the desk,0

greg i ve been working with an it guy here who has been building a spreadsheet for some of us that can receive live prices from eol i ve used this to build a real time matrix which shows spread relationships between different gas locations including variable cost analysis npv etc i think that this would be an extremely useful application to include on the eol site whether it is in excel format or some homemade format for example hunter and i were in chicago last week talking to nicor about analyzing the risk components of their pbr we brought up this idea and they were excited about being able to more clearly see daily cash spreads hedge mtd and bom pbr price with gas daily swaps storage utilization logic etc if we can develop an eol dependent application that is helpful to our customers in terms of how they make trading decisions it will reinforce the importance of using our site over our competitors let me know what you think fletch,0

energy supply setback big generator can t be forced to sell emergency power to the state a u s court rules by denny walsh and carrie peyton bee staff writers published april in a development that does not bode well for california s energy supply a federal appellate court thursday halted enforcement of a lower court order that a big electricity generator must sell emergency power to the state without guarantee of payment state energy officials said the ruling wouldn t have any immediate effect but could precipitate a power emergency if the generator decided to take a plant off line for maintenance on march citing rolling blackouts that have darkened the california landscape u s district judge frank c damrell jr imposed an injunction against reliant energy services inc one of the nation s major generators houston based reliant controls approximately megawatts or about percent of the gas fired generation capacity in the state and damrell found that loss of that production poses an imminent threat but thursday a three judge panel of the th u s circuit court of appeals granted an emergency stay of the injunction saying reliant has shown a high likelihood of success on the merits of its appeal while not spelling it out the panel apparently bases its finding on the question of the courts jurisdiction over the energy market the panel directed that a hearing on the appeal be scheduled for the second week in july the decision leaves california s electric grid more fragile at least temporarily according to the state independent system operator which maintains and controls power transmissions it gives the agency no immediate recourse if reliant chooses to shut down any of its plants for maintenance said iso vice president jim detmers it s not going to change anything overnight and it s not going to change anything over the weekend said detmers but if reliant decided on a unilateral action to take their units off for maintenance we definitely could have a system emergency reliant officials when told of the ruling took a conciliatory tone but declined to specify their next move reliant has pledged to keep the lights on in california said company lobbyist marty wilson and is still of a mind to want to cooperate without further comment the appeals court judges cited a u s district court decision in that case cities sued florida power and light co alleging that it was violating a number of laws in its sales of power and production of electricity the judge found however that the federal power act reserves oversight of interstate utilities exclusively to the federal energy regulatory commission he ruled that only the commission may bring an action involving energy sales into federal court unless it is a request to review a commission order and that goes directly to an appellate court the lawsuit before damrell was brought by the iso to force reliant and two other generators to respond to iso s emergency orders for power even though the agency is buying on behalf of two retailers that are broke and hopelessly in debt because pacific gas and electric co and southern california edison can t pay their bills about billion some wholesalers want to cut off sales to the utilities the other three defendants in the iso s suit dynegy power corp of houston and tulsa based aes corp and its marketer williams energy marketing trading co have entered into written agreements with iso to continue supplying emergency power until the ferc decides whether they are required to sell to companies that are not creditworthy but charles robinson iso general counsel points out that the generators can rescind those agreements with hours notice my hope is this is a temporary setback said robinson he added however that the practical effect is at least for now we don t have a tool to compel them to do what we believe they re obligated to do respond to emergency demands for power reliant has insisted since the suit was filed feb that damrell has no jurisdiction over the rate schedules that govern dealings between generators and the iso and that the federal power act mandates that the ferc must settle any disputes about terms of those tariffs in issuing the injunction damrell acknowledged that the ferc has special expertise concerning agreements between generators and iso absent the extreme exigencies of the california power crisis the court agrees that a stay pending further action by the ferc would be proper he said but those are not the facts here electricity is in critically short supply the health and safety of the people of california are potentially at risk immediately upon receiving the th circuit s order thursday attorneys for the iso asked damrell to set an accelerated schedule for its motion to amend the suit the agency apparently has crafted a new complaint stressing its view that the matter is an ordinary contract dispute over which the judge has jurisdiction damrell scheduled a hearing on the motion for thursday in a further development that could complicate the state s dire need for energy an alternative supplier won a court fight thursday to bypass the big utilities and sell its power on the open market timber giant sierra pacific industries which operates four biomass plants that produce power for pg e obtained a temporary restraining order in sacramento superior court that says sierra pacific is not required to sell its power to pg e the ruling means pg e and southern edison could lose power as alternative energy generators fed up with months of nonpayment sue to be able to sell their comparatively cheap product elsewhere including outside the state,0

forwarded by jeff dasovich sfo ees on pm jeff dasovich pm to jdasovic enron com cc subject possible messages on legislation in california here s an attempt at being frank about the legislation without jeopardizing our relationships or commercial prospects overall we respect the effort but california failed to get the ball over the goal line on siting intentionally or not california has designed power plant siting laws that make it excruciatingly difficult to construct power plants in the state folks seem to have lost sight of the need to balance growth and environmental quality in california that s why nothing s been built in the state for a decade and developers are going outside the state to build power plants tinkering around the edges won t help and with all due respect the legislation passed yesterday tinkers real reform is required if california hopes to build the supply necessary to keep pace with silicon valley and a high tech culture and tame the price spikes if developers continue to have to navigate through a maze of a half a dozen or more state and local agencies california s supply problems will continue or worsen california needs real one stop shopping and it needs it now on the retail price cap they don t work we ve already developed all the arguments so i won t repeat them hear the press has already reported that the measure the legislature passed simply puts off the day of reckoning it s like using your credit card eventually they re going to knock on your door to collect now families and businesses will have a hard time managing their budgets because they can t gauge the size of the balloon payment they ll face a couple of years down the road so san diegans who continue to take service from sdg e will pay the same amount but the cap will remove the powerful incentive prices create to use electricity wisely bad solution there s a better answer instead of urging consumers not to switch encourage customers to sign with another retail provider clearly the biggest mistake california made was neglecting to establish a retail market in its restructuring legislation urging customers to stay with the utility made matters worse given the volatility of the power exchange variable rate mortgage story but some customers who did switch and who took a fixed price deal with companies like ours are doing very well but for the press reports the customers who switched to those deals hardly know there s a crisis so california needs to follow s pennsylvania s lead and make a market that works for retail customers if the price spikes in the px worry you the best way to protect yourself is to leave the utility and switch to another provider who s willing to take on that risk on your behalf remove the monopoly that california originally granted to the px just like the customers who switched the utilities could have bought fixed price power and protected themselves from the px s price volatility but for some crazy reason california forced the utilities to buy everything from px and the utilities have complained about it even former monopolies don t like buying from a monopoly let the utility buy from any competitive source available don t meld the px with the iso that would simply re enforce the px monopoly and make a bad situation much worse make california s iso a for profit transco like we have in our interstate gas pipeline system i leave this last recommendation as food for thought may be too much to bite off have a good holiday best jeff,0

wine shipping measures ferment legislature and lobbyists by laylan copelin american statesman staff monday february in this parched state texas lawmakers are fond of saying that whiskey is for drinking and water is for fighting but legislators are busy turning wine into water squabbling over the selling of wine directly to customers whether over the internet or via tourists shipping wine home to texas for the second legislative session the state s small wineries and the wine institute of california are squaring off against the powerful texas distributors two years ago the licensed beverage distributors of texas tried to make it a felony to ship wine across state lines while the california wineries tried to circumvent the four texas companies that dominate distribution of liquor and wine we fought to a standstill said austin lobbyist sharon hull who represents the wine institute of california now for round two both sides have their flag waving issues on one side are e commerce and questions about the right to free trade among states on the other side are warnings that taxes will go uncollected wine will be sold over the internet to minors and out of state wineries will be bootlegging if they ship to the state s many dry precincts that never approved the sale of alcohol the real issue is money and the fight is between two business models of how to deliver wine to the customer one eliminates the middleman the other honors a delivery system that texas has used since the end of prohibition with rare exceptions texas so called three tier system kept brewers wholesalers and retailers from joint ownership or ventures it prevented a few companies from dominating the alcoholic beverage industry from fermentation to final sale the law did not keep a handful of companies from dominating the wholesaling segment of the industry glazer s distributing co of dallas competes statewide with republic beverage co of houston and block distributing of san antonio block owns percent of republic a fourth longhorn liquors of arlington competes in the dallas area among them they control all the distribution of distilled spirits and an estimated percent of the wine wholesale market in texas that s why some lawmakers want to make changes if the two big wholesale guys don t anoint your wine said state rep david swinford r dumas you re toast in addition to major out of state brands texas distributors sold three fourths of the million gallons of wine produced in texas in yet almost all of that was from the state s four biggest wineries llano estacado st genevieve cap rock and fall creek so called boutique wines from california or from small texas wineries almost never make it to the grocery shelves current law says texans cannot bring into the state more than gallons about two cases of wine per month and buyers must accompany the wine instead of shipping it there are similar limits on beer and liquor also texas wineries can sell only gallons a year to customers at a winery if it is in a wet precinct that allows the sale of alcohol and they can ship only limited amounts of wine to a customer who lives in a wet precinct last year a federal judge in houston said the gallon limit is an unconstitutional restriction on free trade among states the judge has withheld a final ruling probably waiting to see what the legislature will do meanwhile a federal appeals ruling in indiana upholding a state s right to regulate alcohol sales has given wholesalers hope that texas can win on appeal yet two lawmakers swinford and rep anna mowery r fort worth have taken two different tacks to promote wine sales mowery s house bill would keep the gallon limit but create a direct wine shipper s permit allowing wineries to ship to texans a person years or older with proper identification would be required to sign for the delivery and the holder of the shipper s permit would be required to pay all taxes wine could not be shipped into a dry precinct only texas counties allow the sale of alcohol countywide eighty nine percent of the state is either dry or a patchwork of small precincts where alcohol can be sold alan gray director of the licensed beverage distributors opposes the bill he said he believes that minors would be able to buy wine off the internet that local sales taxes would not be collected and that the shippers have no easy way to determine where alcohol sales are legal we think it creates nothing more than an honor system gray said mowery insists that allowing direct shipping of a small amount of wine to customers won t affect wholesalers profits gray argued that if wine wins an exception liquor could be next the texas alcoholic beverage commission which enforces the state s laws is not allowed to support or oppose legislation randy yarbrough the agency s assistant director said mowery s bill could provide equal treatment to texas wholesalers and out of state wineries yet the agency would have to work out collection and payment of sales taxes to cities also there is no easy way such as a database for shippers to determine areas of the state where alcohol can be sold no one at the state level knows where the wet and dry areas are yarbrough said as for sale to minors yarbrough said states that allow internet sales have used minors in sting operations but he believes that sales to minors remain a bigger problem for local retailers kids generally do not want to buy alcohol over the internet yarbrough said they want it for tonight swinford the panhandle republican takes a texas only approach house bill would allow texas wineries to ship up to two cases of wine per month within the state even into dry areas wineries in dry counties also could sell wine on the premises just as private clubs do with memberships i call this bill direct ship lite joked swinford swinford said his bill will develop the texas wine industry gray argues that it may be illegal because it would favor texas wineries over out of state ones swinford said texas wineries need the help california produces times the wine that texas does but consumes only three times as much this is not a booze bill he said i

that many large companies pay no taxes by david cay johnston   the new york times page column c new york times company goodyear texaco colgate palmolive mci worldcom and eight other large corporations earned more than billion in profits in through but none of them ended up owing corporate income taxes over that period according to a study released yesterday indeed as a group the companies received million in credits or refunds the report found the study of large publicly traded companies showed that owed no tax or received credits against past or future tax obligations in up from in and in the study also found that of the companies paid taxes at less than half the official percent corporate rate during the three year period the study was conducted by the institute on taxation and economic policy a washington research organization associated with citizens for tax justice a nonprofit group supported in part by labor unions the group argues that the tax system favors the rich and politically connected corporate profits overall soared percent during the three year period but corporate tax revenues grew just percent a disjunction that has drawn intense interest from the treasury department and some members of congress who are concerned about the growing market for tax shelters and their abuse in recent years congress has watered down the overhaul of the tax laws which lowered rates and eliminated most tax shelters and was supposed to simplify reporting the recent changes have opened fresh opportunities for corporations to cut their taxes the study found corporate taxes are not rising along with profits because companies have found all sorts of ways to get around the reforms in the tax act said robert s mcintyre the director of citizens for tax justice companies also have gotten a lot of help from congress especially in gutting the minimum tax rules mr mcintyre said that he and t d coo nguyen the co author spent more than two years examining financial statements the companies sent to shareholders all but of the companies studied are on the fortune list and the others are in the fortune he said companies were excluded if they lost money or their tax disclosures were crafted so that you could not figure them out at least two companies objected to the study s methodology keith price a spokesman for goodyear said the study did not appear to consider an accounting rule affecting its sale of a pipeline subsidiary in it made no objection to the and figures michael n ambler texaco s chief tax counsel said that his company had tax disputes with the internal revenue service that were unresolved after more than a decade if those disputes are settled with a refund he said that can easily distort the figures for any one year he said that even the three year study period was too short to give an accurate picture timothy mccormally of the tax executives institute which represents officials at large companies told bloomberg news that the companies named in the report did nothing wrong there is nothing in the report that suggests that any of this results from any illegal or improper activity he said the study by the washington institute showed that the corporate tax burden was falling in many cases because of the growing use of stock options which are an expense for tax purposes but do not count against profits reported to shareholders recent annual reports filed by microsoft and cisco systems indicate that they paid no federal income taxes in because stock options exercised by employees wiped out profits for tax purposes the study found that general electric i b m pfizer intel and bristol myers squibb also sharply reduced their tax rates because of stock options without having to show reduced earnings to shareholders the most significant factor in the easing corporate tax burden mr mcintyre said can be traced to actions in congress which relaxed the corporate minimum tax in when the democrats were in control of both the house and senate and again in after the republicans had taken over congress made it easier for corporations to spread tax breaks and profits over many years including reaching back to past years to get tax breaks that could not be used at the time in at least one of the three years studied of the large companies studied paid no federal income tax those companies reported billion in profits to shareholders in the years they paid no taxes if they had been obligated to pay the full percent corporate rate the tax bill would have been billion but the companies received billion in refunds in total dollars general electric was the biggest beneficiary of tax breaks the study said saving billion in three years the company paid billion in income taxes on billion in profits for a tax rate of percent the highest tax rate for the three years was paid by winn dixie stores which paid an average of percent of its through profits in federal income taxes it was one of two companies

jones company inc all rights reserved oct pm houston chronicle arena boosters tout benefits some question property sales tax numbers new development by eric berger copyright houston chronicle enron field sparked the redevelopment of downtown s east side boosters say and an arena would crown the revitalization of the long neglected area a strongly pro arena business organization central houston inc released a flurry of positive economic numbers to back its contention that enron field is a boon to downtown as well as to city county and school tax coffers and that the arena would be as well there s no better way to measure the impact of sports facilities on downtown than to look at the one we already have said the organization s president bob eury as he crooked a finger toward the ballpark eury and other boosters outlined three economic benefits to houston they say are related to sports facilities increased property tax revenues a wealth of new development in the area and a boost in sales tax collected but economic analysts questioned some of their conclusions when enron field was built nine blocks were taken off the tax rolls at a cost of about in lost property taxes eury said though that it was not a bad trade he noted that properties around the ballpark have leaped in value since the enron field project began in the mid s in turn the annual property tax collected on land and buildings within four blocks of the ballpark is million greater now than in but harris county tax assessor collector paul bettencourt said those figures are due in part to the boom in land values across downtown including the central business district since bettencourt said he hoped to have an analysis finished today to determine whether land values around enron field had increased at a greater rate than land in the rest of downtown the boosters also highlighted more than million worth of private developments planned but not yet completed near the ballpark including the million story ballpark place tower across crawford street from enron field without a doubt if enron field was not there ballpark place would not be there said john holland an executive vice president for the trammel crow co which expects to break ground on the project in early because the arena would be built in an urban core even academics who are skeptical about the economic benefits of sports stadiums agreed that spin off development is likely nearby but independent economists who have studied such issues including brad humphreys an assistant professor at the university of maryland baltimore county say development near a stadium usually has a negative impact on development and businesses in other parts of a city the focus must be on the entire market humphreys said not just in the vicinity of a sports facility public subsidization of stadiums and arenas isn t necessarily a bad thing he said but when they sell them as economic engines it s just absolutely wrong the research doesn t show that a recent study humphreys co authored which appeared in the fall issue of the journal of policy analysis and management found that the presence of professional sports teams in a market on average actually reduced the per capita income in those markets compared with similar markets without such teams given houston s strong economy eury said he does not believe downtown development will detract from other areas of the city as humphreys studies have shown in other markets a third major economic benefit offered thursday was that a new arena with the houston rockets and houston comets as tenants would generate million a year in sales tax revenues about million of that would go into local coffers with the remainder going to the state according to the study performed for eury s group by csl international a consulting firm yet even in the absence of a new arena and both teams many economists say a large portion of those expenditures would be spent in the area anyway that is known as a substitution effect instead of a family going to a game it might go to the movies or local zoo and corporations are likely to sponsor other local events out of their advertising budgets the economists say the csl study did not account for this substitution effect in calculating the sales tax impact said bill rhoda the firm s director study dozens of corporations pay little or no income tax by curt anderson ap tax writer  associated press newswires copyright the associated press all rights reserved washington ap dozens of america s most profitable companies enjoyed tax free years during the s largely because of legal tax breaks an independent study released thursday found the report by the nonprofit institute on taxation and economic policy found that companies paid an effective tax rate of percent in down from percent just two years before the federal income tax rate for corporations is supposed to be percent of the companies studied enjoyed at least one year of no income taxes or an actual rebate from the federal government despite pretax profits of billion from if all companies had paid the full percent on billion in pretax profits the study estimated the total income tax would have come to billion but tax breaks put into law by congress lowered those companies tax bills by billion over the three year period companies getting tax rebates in alone included texaco chevron pepsico j p morgan enron and general motors the report found the study s chief author robert s mcintyre said companies lower their taxes through such breaks as depreciation write offs tax credits for research and development and deductions they take when employees exercise stock options we hope our findings will encourage lawmakers to re examine this important area of taxation mcintyre said the report also found that the petroleum industry paid the lowest tax rate from at percent followed by electronics at percent forest and paper products at percent and transportation at percent at the other end of the spectrum publishing and printing companies paid percent gas and electric utilities paid percent and retail and wholesale trade companies paid percent anyone who worries about our economy s long term growth has to wonder why the tax code is being used to favor some industries and some kinds of investments over others rather than letting market forces decide mcintyre said  on the net institute on taxation and economic policy site http www itepnet org copyright dow jones company inc all rights reserved us rep drafts bill to impose windfall tax on pwr companies by jason leopold  dow jones energy service copyright c dow jones company inc of dow jones newswires los angeles dow jones california s summer of soaring wholesale electricity prices helped boost the stock price of many energy companies in the third quarter but if u s rep bob filner d calif gets his way those companies will be forced to pay back hundreds of millions of dollars in profit to utilities customers and the government filner introduced a bill in the house of representatives last week that would impose a windfall profit tax on wholesale power sold throughout the western u s the bill which was referred to the house committee on ways and means may be discussed in december or january according to filner and if he gets enough support by the mostly republican caucus companies like enron corp ene duke energy north america duk southern co so reliant energy rei and dynegy dyn would only be allowed to show a certain amount of profit and anything over that amount would be taxed filner said the amount of profit hasn t been determined but his bill calls for a baseline that would be a just and reasonable amount of profit the congressman s san diego constituents were paying market based electricity rates in the summer which resulted in triple digit utility bills he said generators are gouging california customers and need to be held responsible this is not just a problem of supply and demand filner told dow jones newswires this is stealing and we want our money back state and federal regulators are conducting separate investigations into california s wholesale power crisis the findings expected to be complete in about two weeks are aimed at determining if generators or other key players manipulated the state s wholesale energy market at least two major energy companies are being investigated by california attorney general bill lockyer a high level source working on the probe with the attorney general said third quarter earnings statements will play a major role in finding out if generators manipulated the market their investigation isn t turning up much evidence but earnings statements are showing that profits are up significantly largely due to wholesale prices in california the source said at least one federal energy regulatory commissioner who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the wholesale electricity market in california will be in for a rude awakening when the agency completes its investigation there will be some serious structural changes to the market the commissioner said representatives from energy companies told dow jones newswires that higher profits weren t the result of illegal activity or manipulating the market energy cos say summer crisis boosted q earnings on wednesday duke energy which owns and operates power plants in california said in an earnings statement that third quarter profit rose due in part to high wholesale prices in california in the summer enron and several other companies reported similar third quarter increases based on california s summer of skyrocketing power prices the congressman doesn t want to limit the proposed windfall tax to california but where generators sell power in the western u s but even filner admits that forcing generators to refund part of their profits isn t getting the early support it needs to become law if the democrats were in charge i d have this bill voted on already filner said filner said if the bill is passed some of the money would be refunded to consumers and utilities the victims as he refers to them meanwhile he s also working on getting the house to pass a separate bill to roll back electricity rates in the western u s to pre deregulation levels and he s trying to gather support for a wind power initiative regardless of the outcome the congressman is dead set on making noise if nothing happens i m thinking about holding a press conference with the san diego district attorney he

wall street s dirty little secret it was the spring of i was just a tall goofy looking kid in middle school with buck teeth and freckles each day in the cafeteria i walked from table to table stealing other kids lunch money no i didn t rob them with a gun or a knife i just made them a little deal let me borrow two dollars today i said and i ll bring you five dollars next week the investment was too good to pass up and other kids were throwing their lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes of course when next week rolled around and i couldn t pony up the cash i promised to pay them even more the week after that if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit longer eventually the end of the year came and went high school started and with it came girls and homework and parties and sports and those poor kids from eighth grade had more things on their mind than last year s lunch money i made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid and i didn t even get beat up hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market secrets you will ever learn first of all greed is your number one enemy you re not going to turn into in a week so cash out when you re ahead don t wait for the boat to sink before grabbing the lifejacket second never trust an investment adviser of any kind they are looking out for their own money not yours the professionals those stuffy investment counselors and money managers will always tell you that the best time to buy is now according to those guys the longer you keep your money in the market the more money you re going to make ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is never in a sense they are right if you put in an index fund right now you ll probably have over a million dollars in thirty or forty years but here s the problem do you want to wait thirty or forty years to be rich hell no you want the money now so you can enjoy it it s hard to make use of your fortune when you re seventy years old in a wheelchair if you could make a million dollars in the next few years what would you do with it where would you travel what kind of car would you buy the fact is youth is the best time to be rich if your goal is to make quick profits in the market volatility is your ally and stability your enemy you want to see those large upswings two hundred points in a day followed by the four hundred point

which they d charge you forty or fifty dollars they make their money only if you believe two lies that investing is too difficult and risky for the average person that using an investment adviser who charges a high commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks per trade here is what the financial gurus in today s society absolutely positively do not want you to know the strategies for

urgent contact from the desk of dr tom eke e mail dr tomeke spinfinder com lagos nigeria attn request for urgent business relationship it is with my profound dignity that i write you this very important and highly confidential letter first i must solicit your strictest confidentiality in this transaction this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret though i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried considering the fact that we have not met each other before but i am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day we have decided to contact you by email due to the urgency of this transaction as we have been reliably informed that it will take at least a minimum of two to three weeks for a normal post to reach you so we decided it is best using the e mail which is quicker and also to enable us meet up with the second quater payment for the year however let me start by introducing myself properly to you i am dr tom eke a director general in the department of petroleum resources d p r and i presently head the contract award panel incharge of contract awards and payment approvals i came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential business transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence i and my colleagues are top officials of the federal government contract award panel our duties include evaluation vetting approval for payment of contract jobs done for the d p r e t c in order to commence this business we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said funds the source of this funds is as follows in the second quarter of this committee was mandated to review and award contracts to the tune of us million us dollars to a group of five firms for the supply construction and installation of oil pipe lines in warri and port harcourt during this process my colleagues and i decided and agreed among ourselves to deliberately over inflate the total contract sum from us million to us million united states dollars with the main intention of sharing the remaining sum of us miilion amongst ourselves the federal government of nigeria has since the second quater of year approved the sum of us million for us as the contract sum and the sum of us million has also been paid to the foreign companies concerned as contract entitlements for the various contracts done but since the companies are entiltled to us million dollars only we are now left with us million dollars balance in the account which we intend to disburse amongst ourselves but by virtue of our positions as civil servants and members of this panel we cannot do this by ourselves as we are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau civil service laws from opening and or operating foreign accounts in our names while still in government service making it impossible for us to acquire the money in our names right now i have therefore been delegated as a matter of trust and urgency by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner into whose account we would transfer the sum of us million hence we are writing you this letter my colleagues and i have agreed that if you or your company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our behalf you or your company will retain of the total amount us million while will be for us officials and the remaining will be used in offsetting all debts expenses and taxes incurred both local and foreign in the cause of this transfer needless to say the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous in return we demand your complete honesty and trust you must however note that this transaction will be strictly based on the following terms and conditions as we have stated below a our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence b that you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and confidentiality c that you will not ask for more share or try to sit on the funds once it is under your custody or any form of blackmail d that upon receipt of the funds you will release the funds as instructed by us after you have removed your share of from the total amount please note that this transaction is legal and risk free and we hope to conclude this transaction seven to fourteen bank working days from the date of receipt of the necessary requirements from you we are looking forward to doing business with you and solicit your total confidentiality in this transaction there is no cause for alarm i give you my word that you are completely safe in doing business with us transactions like this have been successfully carried out in the past by most government executives here in my country there is great economic and political disarray and thus looting and corruption is rampant and the order of the day thus explaining why you might have heard stories of how money is been taken out of nigeria this is because everyone is making desperate attempts to secure his or her future so that when we retire from active service we donot languish in poverty i will explain more to you when i have heard from you please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using the above e mail address i will bring you into the complete picture of this pending business transaction when i have heard from you and also receive your confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me fax to you all necessary information you need to know about our pending business transaction i will also send to you my private telephone and fax numbers where you can always reach me your urgent response will be highly appreciated to enable us transfer the funds under the second quarter of the year thank you and god bless yours faithfully dr tom eke n b please be informed that this business transaction is legal and completely free from drug money or money laundering this is a complete legitimate business

i still had pimples george burns it s summer vacation time and parents will soon be hearing from their kids that they re bored one of the biggest regrets we hear from the older generation is that kids lack the playful imagination that was common a generation or two ago back in the olden days kids knew how to entertain themselves with surprisingly little there was no such thing as playstation kids

http www pocketwarmers com d just imagine by michael t smith when i married ginny i gained a new son daughter and four grandsons i became an instant grandpa over the july th holiday i got to meet my new daughter and her three boys for the first time it took a day for my new grandsons to warm up to me the first day they stared at me perhaps wondering what they were supposed to do with this man who they were told is grandpa i waited patiently i knew boys like to play they d come to me in their own time on day two the oldest two were doing summersaults over my lap the youngest ben took a little longer but yesterday he raced me across the yard thirty times and won every time the weekend brought back memories of my own childhood we had such imaginations in our minds a tree was a tower to spot approaching bad guys a big rock became a mountain a fallen log a space ship headed to the stars we had toys but we had to use our imagination not like the new toys i see my grandkids with our toys didn t talk and if they did you pulled a string to make it work we had blocks to build crayons to create trucks and cars to push they were simple toys that required imagination i thought about the toys in my garage the ones i saved when my children outgrew them they were simple and needed their imagination to work mr potato head allowed them to learn parts of the body and giggle at the funny face with an ear where its mouth should have been i still have an old plastic phone it has a dial to turn a bell that rings when you push a button and that s it it doesn t talk squawk beep or move around the room it s simple and was used when they played house nurse doctor and secretary i have a toy doctor s bag with all the plastic doctor s tools i remember all the broken bones cuts bangs scratches and aches my daughter repaired as i lay in her office moaning most toys today do it all we don t need imagination it comes in a box video games that take us into another world or reality talking toys with vocabularies better than most people computerized toys to teach the alphabet kids sit and have imagination brought to them the teaching toys are great but children tire of them it s like being in school when my son was young and tired of his toys he would come to me and say dad i m bored go find something to do i d reply i don t know what to do go outside and find a friend naaa i don t want to do that use your imagination huh he asked well when i was young you know the routine sports is the same we re entertained for hours watching someone else have fun doing what they re good at wouldn t it be better to be playing yourself if we don t like the sports available to watch we create new ones it doesn t matter what people will pay to see it because they need to be entertained i haven t heard of world championship worm digging but if someone offered a large cash price people would buy tickets to scream at the contestants i worry are we becoming a society that needs outside influence to have fun i think i ll go climb a tree maybe there s a pirate ship on the horizon or someone is attacking my castle just imagine michael t smith michael lives in new jersey with his new wife and son from our mailbag in response to last week s story cinderella men dear heartwarmers last week s heartwarming story opened a door to memory lane i too was born in the s and felt some of the poverty of that time i remember my mom and dad who never complained of the fatigue that was so ever present in their lives we were very fortunate in as much as we always had plenty of food and warm shelter we had a garden and salvaged every edible product available even certain weeds that were quite tasty after mother got all the spices in them i had several beautiful dresses made from feed sacks that i wore with pride we were very poor but so rich indeed because we had love and the knowledge that god was upper most in our lives and it taught us lessons that had never been printed in the books i deeply appreciate those lessons of long ago because they have taught me how to handle the tough times we have encountered in this life of prosperity and promise thank you again for your lovely

stephen white head up company dedicated to bringing the next generation of online gaming read full interview the asian market according to the diffusion group and game trust china will become the online gaming market by more investors are making huge gains as the world bets online could gaming transactions inc gtts be the next stock to rock recently we read an article in the economist that highlighted online gaming and how it has become a socially acceptable form of entertainment over the next few days as we thought about what sort of impact this trend could have we started to notice that online gambling was being discussed all over the media in newspapers online and on television it became obvious to us that more and more people were jumping on the internet to bet on games we

months although ggts is a new company it has some surprisingly experienced players at the helm an uncommon thing to find in an industry only ten years old the company has come out with online versions of the addictive game keno and its management team was smart enough to secure the rights to the keno com website which if youre marketing keno is as good as it gets keno has the widest spread for the house of any mainstream gambling game ggts is also about to launch a suite of other online gambling games including poker and sports book betting once it offers these popular games and given that it already has keno com online the company could bring in great revenues attracting a lot of attention in the investment community and driving up its stock price after a successful north american launch gaming transactions inc gtts has translated its games into chinese and is about to hit asia this initiative looks like a wise business decision many analysis anticipate that china will be the biggest source of online gambling revenue by so the company could be poised for massive expansion in terms of both profits and global reach what does all this tell us a brand new company a popular well known

internet success through simplicity every day of the week i get questions from people all over the world including my no bs gimg members wanting to know some of the most valuable secrets to my on going internet success let me say above all else i don t believe there are any true secrets to success on the net what you do to become successful in the online world is not a secret in my opinion most successful people follow simple clear repeatedly proven strategies to succeed whether on the net or off but when it comes to someone asking for advice consultation or simply asking what s your secret i have to blush say persistence and personality of course i always follow the advice with my own little disclaimer what makes me successful may not work the same for you your first lesson is to get over the deep seeded idea that success of any kind in my opinion is somehow an unknown unattainable secret clearly it is not it s not unknown it s not unattainable it s not years of digging to find the secrets to internet riches one thing that gets to me so often in my work as an internet consultant author and internet success strategist is that so many people on the net seem to have this incredibly huge mental block that stands between themselves and success on the net it s almost as if they ve been barraged by so many claims of what works and what doesn t work and so many long complicated routes to actually succeeding in their online venture that success is the equivelant of a foot high brick wall it s not that difficult my friends it is not that complicated long time friend and business associate rick beneteau has a new ebook out called branding you breaking the bank get it http www roibot com bybb cgi im bybtb but the reason i mention this is the fact that he talks so dynamically about the true simplicity of making your online venture a success and yes rick i come from the same school of self marketing marketing you obviously that s the core of his excellent new ebook and i couldn t agree with him more point being you are everything you do online to succeed you are your web site your business your marketing piece your customer service your customers experiences with your business all of it is you read his ebook you ll see more of what i m saying the matter at hand is that brick wall you might have standing high as you can see blocking the path between you internet success listen to me it is not real ok it doesn t exist there s nothing there to fear to begin with get over it what i m telling you is the only thing standing between you and the success you most desire is yourself when you realize this you will tear down that brick wall by means of complete and instantaneous disintegration it will no longer exist in your mind which is the only real place it ever was anyhow yes persistence and personality inherently includes honesty integrity accountability and many other qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate goals and realize that probably the most valuable powerful key to your success is you that may be the most incredible secret we ever uncover in our lifetime and trust me that brick wall won t ever get in your way again unless you let it talk about simple bryan is a veteran internet consultant author internet success strategist marketer he publishes mega success com chronicles to over

interest in one section symbo eogi price the value of eogi s shares will skyrocket price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest buil market in a generation natural gas prices have tripied in the ast two years with multipie projects in high gear and the expanding production on reserves worth multi miliions eogi is seiling for less than the vaiue of its assets emerson oi and gas specializes in using new technoiogy to turn unproductive oi and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises already shares in the oi and gas sector are rising faster than the overa market in fact four of dow jones ten top performing industry sectors for the past year are energy reiated but it s in the mid sized expiorers and developers ike emerson eogi that the biggest gains are being made in the last months many of these stocks made triple and even quadrupie returns our subscribers need to pay particularly close attention to undervalued eogi shares because it won t be a bargain for ong this smail company with a comparably sma market vaiue is sitting on a bonanza of oil and gas reserves an unrecognized bonus for investors especialiy with the daily jump in energy prices but ail that wiil change

what wil the cash flow from these projects do for the price of emerson oi and gas shares weil we do know this the great thing about investing in eogi is that your gains don t depend on further increases in the price of oi and gas even if energy prices stay fiat or deciine slightly you wil stil make a very healthy return of course energy prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year or so as predicted meaning the vaiue of eogi s assets and earnings wil soar even higher in that case the reward for investors wil be staggering overa we consider eogi to be one of

momentum continues sales projections for next months surpasses million revenue increase net income increase stockholders equity increase increase in assets million order backlog million manufacturing capacity overview global diversified industries operates in the modular building construction industry and strategically targets the california education sector gdvi is strategically located in central california on acres with a square foot state of the art manufacturing facility throughout and the company focused on building its infrastructure through acquisitions development of a state of the art manufacturing facility and by securing the requisite financing facilities to fuel business growth through the combination of its new facility million capacity the increased demand for portable buildings and the state of california s bond approvals gdvi has become well positioned to become one of the dominant leaders in modular manufacturing on the west coast gdvi should benefit greatly from the billion school improvement bond that is expected to be passed by california voters next month march this presents in our opinion an opportunity for early investors of gdvi to also benefit before the mainstream investor realizes who the benefactors are and subsequently invests in those companies global diversified has taken numerous strategic development steps throughout and including generating strong revenues as well as profits and is now poised for explosive growth in the company is led by a strong management team with previous success in building companies into million per annum businesses in the past year gdvi has exceeded its own sales revenue projections renewed its piggyback contract received state approvals on engineered product designs started a new credit facility and opened its new square foot manufacturing facility the company will continue to seek new acquisition candidates through its aggressive growth plan profile gdvi is a holding company that currently operates two wholly owned subsidiaries mbs construction inc a modular contractor specializing in modular construction site work and renovation and global modular inc a sales marketing and manufacturing of modular type structures its principal customer base is currently educational public and private schools universities etc child care and municipality sectors its product lines consist of a variety of portable classroom designs including both single story and two story floor plans global modular s portable classroom structures are engineered and constructed in accordance with pre approved building plans commonly referred to as p c s or pre checked plans that conform to structural and seismic safety specifications administered by the california department of state architects dsa global modular also enjoys the benefit of providing educational customers with products contracted under a piggyback clause the state of california allows school districts to canvass proposals from modular classroom vendors under a bidding process where the successful bidder can provide other public school districts and municipalities portable classrooms under a piggyback contract issued by the originating school district this process saves school districts valuable time and resources from the necessity of soliciting bids a modular vendor who possesses a piggyback contract containing competitive pricing and a variety of design options may have access to future business for up to five years depending on the term of the piggyback contract the strategic focus on california schools since california legislation has required that at least of all new classrooms constructed with state funds be portable structures there are five compelling reasons for this trend modular classrooms are faster to construct as quickly as weeks they cost significantly less as low as vs they offer greater flexibility for use compared to conventional buildings they are easier to finance they provide financing incentives to cope with population growth the state department of education estimates that california will need more than classrooms each year for the next four years which equates to more than classrooms due to the current and projected budget cuts throughout the california education sector public and private schools are expected to turn to portable modular construction to fulfill their additional classroom requirements over the next four years the california schools budget crisis on november a billion school facilities improvements bond proposal proposition was passed by california voters this bond measure passage does not include an approximate billion worth of local bond measures passed by various school districts throughout the state a second bond measure worth billion went before the voters on the march these bond measures are about three times higher than the record billion bond california voters approved in the revenue generated from these bond measures will be used for school modernization programs which include requirements for relocatable classrooms and modular classroom construction and renovations money from the bonds will help overcrowded public and private schools design upgrades and expand building space at community colleges and other institutions of higher learning throughout california gdvi business infrastructure among global

not work for you remember honesty reaps the reward this is a legitimate business you are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it treat it as such and you will be very profitable in a short period of time after you have ordered all reports take this advertisement and remove the name address of the person in report this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their

purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e mails legally where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more there are primary methods to get this venture going method by sending bulk e mail legally let s say that you decide to start small just to see how it goes and we will assume you and those involved send out only e mails each let s also assume that the mailing receive only a of response the response could be much better but lets just say it is only also many peoplewill send out hundreds of thousands e mails instead of only each continuing with this example you send out only e mails with a response that is only orders for report those people responded by sending out e mail each for a total of out of those e mails only responded with orders that s people responded and ordered report those people mail out e mails each for a total of e mails the response to that is orders for report those people send e mail each for a total of million e mail sent out the response is orders for report those people send out e mails each for a total of million e mails the response to that is orders for report that s orders times each half a million dollars your total income in this example is grand total numbers do not lie get a pencil paper and figure out the worst possible responses and no matter how you calculate it you will still make a lot of money remember friend this is assuming only people ordering out of you mailed to dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one th of those people mailed e mails each or more there are over million people on the internet worldwide and counting with thousands more coming on line every day believe me many people will do just that and more method by placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response we strongly suggest you start with method and add method as you go along for every you receive all you must do is e mail them the report they ordered that s it always provide same day service on all orders this will guarantee that the e mail they send out with your name and address on it will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report available reports the reason for the cash is not because this is illegal or somehow wrong it is simply about time time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved etc concealing it is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you order each report by its number name only notes always send cash u s currency for each report checks not accepted make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least sheets of paper on one of those sheets of paper write the number the name of the report you are ordering your e mail address and your name and postal address

found my medium size post office box crammed with orders i made in the first weeks the nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live there simply isn t a better investment with a faster return and so big dan sondstrom alberta canada i had received this program before i deleted it but later i wondered if i should have given it a try of course i had no idea who to contact

x bcc industry giants can t match this opportunity another ground breaking news alert from rlyc the potential stored value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately million people of which only about million now maintain active stored value debit card accounts one company is quickly entering a trillion market space with a proposed portfolio of product and service offerings that even the largest multi national corporations in its industry may have a hard time matching in just a few months this company has begun adding and developing innovative new products and targeting acquisitions that could help it reach millions of new long term customers that could generate tremendous re occurring revenues for many years to come although you have probably never heard of this company you may soon hear of it even if you don t continue reading this message that s because it is making a major push to put its products in the hands of a half million people in the u s within the next year an upstart company to make a real impact in a two trillion dollar industry in reality this company s lack of early recognition could be a major plus for you since the overwhelming majority of investors and institutions don t know this company or what they plan to accomplish their stock is trading at rock bottom prices but if they do accomplish even a small part of what they have set out to do over the coming months and years this company could become a significant player in its trillion dollar industry and its stock reflect its accomplishments the company that we ll introduce you to today is relay capital corp pink sheets rlyc rlyc which recently went public is a multi faceted financial services company that focuses primarily on the stored value card market rlyc s present product and service offerings include pre paid stored value cards reward cards employee payroll cards gift retail and affinity group cards travel cards and funds transfer cards these services are aimed at a significant market both domestically and internationally just because a company is in a large and growing industry doesn t necessarily ensure that it will be a winner in order to be successful that company also needs to be truly innovative have very strong partners be able to reach vast customer bases and have a management team capable of putting it all together and turning its goals into reality rlyc appears to be that company below we ll discuss this substantial potential market rlyc is after and what sets rlyc apart from the competition the potential stored value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately million people of which only about million now maintain active stored value debit card accounts stored value cards have the potential to help the million adults and their families who have been excluded from the e commerce revolution because they do not have access to credit or banking facilities the implications reverberate across industry segments estimates suggest stored value transactions could exceed trillion in just a few years rlyc s focus is on providing stored value cards to the un banked and under banked these terms refer to consumers that that do not have a bank account debit card the size of that group is staggering that s about one third of the nation s work force rlyc capitalizes on the dilemma these consumers face by providing stored value card programs that make it easy fast and secure for people and businesses to buy all manners of goods and services using stored value cards as well as for the un banked and under banked to be paid their salaries via the same cards but that s not all the benefits relay will offer on its stored value cards as well as other financial services will also be of great benefit to those who already have banking relationships in this segment relay plans to offer more services with greater convenience for less cost to the consumer who wouldn t want that the payroll market is another enormous market for rlyc for the under and un banked collecting their pay cashing payroll checks and then paying bills with those funds can be extremely complicated and time consuming rlyc s stored value pay transfer card program presents a very effective and innovative solution for this problem rlyc s pay transfer card program can lower costs to employers to process payroll for the banked and the un banked alike lower costs to cardholders to potentially transfer cash between u s cards cards in foreign countries and services bought through the cards improved employee retention improved customer retention will all be available thanks to rlyc various programs will make life much easier for cardholders using the system while also providing the convenience and flexibility of either visa or mastercard purchasing power or hour access to their money through atms rlyc signs loi with national staffing company to use its pay transfer cards earlier this year rlyc signed a binding letter of intent to provide a pay transfer card program for asgard global resources llc click to go to their site a leader in providing technical craft and administrative staffing services to businesses industry and government through locations in houston dallas long island orlando phoenix and southern california all areas with huge un and under banked populations the potential market for this service is really big it includes large employers companies that process payroll and financial institutions that provide banking and payroll services to commercial customers this system will simplify payments to widely dispersed employees and contractors while dramatically decreasing payroll distribution by offering a cost effective alternative to printing cutting and mailing paper payroll checks it also helps to reduce a great deal of paper processing of checks and pay eliminate lost checks stop payments and minimize fraud but best of all this should help to significantly boost rlyc s revenues billion sent worldwide by relatives to home countries mexicans in u s send billion a year back to mexico with billion being transferred internationally each year remittances are a really big business in times past people wanting to send money to relatives back in their home countries had few choices many times their only choice was an expensive proposition like western union more recently more and more people have resorted to purchasing and mailing money orders in order to try to cut down on the cost of sending remittances the problems with traditional money transfer methods with wire services there are any number of inherent problems when trying to send money to relatives overseas first wiring funds across borders can be expensive this can make it very cost prohibitive to send smaller amounts of cash and often means that relatives must wait longer to receive their remittances because the sender has to save up until the amount is large enough to warrant the cost associated with the wire service next there is the problem of logistics both the sender and the recipient must be able to easily reach a storefront that offers the same wire company s services even if they both are able to do this the recipient may have to make multiple trips to the wire service office to check to see if their funds have cleared yet and can be released to them lastly the sender and the recipient are subjected to varying service fees depending on which wire service they choose these fees can be very high and can significantly cut into the amount of money the recipient ultimately receives so even though using a wire service may be a fairly fast way to transfer money it can be very expensive and logistically difficult to use with money orders there is always the problem of mail service although in america we have grown accustomed to relatively quick and reliable mail service this is not always the case in foreign countries this is especially true in underdeveloped nations where most remittances are sent a letter containing a remittance that a family is depending on to provide much needed food and shelter could take many days or even weeks to arrive and there is always the chance that it will never arrive at its destination at all meaning that the sender s family could go hungry or end up on the streets what is the best way to send remittances by far the most convenient fast safe and ultimately cost efficient method to send remittances is through a stored value card with this type of service a person can easily activate a card and then just deposit funds into the account onto the card via loading station telephone or the internet for easy use by relatives in his or her home country the process is extremely easy and cost effective funds can be added to

capital hill gold chgi potential high grade gold deposit breaking news denver june business wire capital hill gold inc chgi reports that the company s geologists are evaluating a potential high grade bulk tonnage gold deposit located in mineral county nevada the project is situated in the vicinity of several operating and past producing gold mines including the paradise peak santa fe and rawhide deposits after review of usgs geochemical survey work of the project and a study of the geology of other gold deposits in the area geologists believe that the target would be a high grade bulk tonnage gold deposit virgin deposits the privately held acre project was originally staked by a major gold mining company in the s the property has never been drilled and may prove to be a rich vein as early tests have indicated follow up work by the company s geologist indicated that a major international gold mining company had staked approximately unpatented lode mining claims in the area during and geologists investigating the property for capital hill observed multiple broad zones of silicification extending for considerable distances samples were collected from several outcrops on the property and have been submitted to american assay labs in elko nevada for assaying based on positive assay results target and identification a major claim staking program will be launched accordingly as further credible evidence emerges of a significant gold ore deposit and the first results coming in are showing promise on june the company announced in a press release that capital hill s management is pleased and encouraged with the first u o uranium oxide assay returns as well as the noticeable precious metal results and that initial reconnaissance sampling on the company s uranium project has returned assays grading u o to u o of great interest to the company is the fact that the samples taken also assayed positively for precious metals with results ranging from to oz ag st and trace amounts of gold the occurrence of silver in conjunction with the uranium mineralization warrants further investigation the recent news of the company possibly sitting on a huge untapped gold deposit has the stock in a strong up trend rallying from cents to cents during the past three months as the three month chart illustrates trading volume has swelled to shares per day with money flow indicators showing strong inflows which is representative of a stock that is under accumulation the positive tape action clearly shows strong investor sentiment about the company s leverage on controlling sizable parcels of gold fields the potential recoverable gold data has yet to be compiled but as mentioned above early tests are very promising which is why investors are bidding up shares ahead of this data capital hill gold s strategic objective is to obtain controlling interests in properties with excellent exploration potential to become economically significant to world class ore deposits chgi intends to acquire mineral exploration properties primarily through the filing of concessions on its own account and in partnership as well as by optioning exceptional properties at reasonable costs relative to the property s potential and the financial capabilities of the company in recent weeks chgi shareholders have been on the receiving end of some very promising developments with the new discoveries for gold ore in addition the company is aggressively exploring for commercial grade uranium deposits that will supply newly heightened demand from nuclear utilities since uranium prices have doubled of the world s electricity comes from uranium and the nuclear power plant count is stable and growing the united states needs to add about nuclear power plants over the next two decades to meet burgeoning demand for electric power and maintain the current generating mix nils j diaz chairman of the u s nuclear regulatory commission told reporters in early may as of may the company is pleased to report that the claim staking crew and geologist have arrived on site and have begun staking claims the area being staked encompasses a large area of potentially commercial grade uranium mineralization identified by previous work including geophysical surveys reconnaissance sampling of the ground being staked has returned assay results approximately equal to those of in place resources at one of the past producing uranium mines in the project area a chinese news web site reports that china the world s second largest energy consumer after the u s will spend billion yuan u s billion on building new nuclear power plants by this is a bigger number than we have seen in the past the energy hungry country intends to increase the amount of installed nuclear power capacity from the current gigawatts to gigawatts within years nuclear power generation is expected to triple to reach gigawatts by that time so the market for uranium is in a new bull market conclusion development efforts for gold and uranium on chgi properties are about to commence following the better than expected geophysical testing results shares of chgi have rallied over fold in just the past three months in anticipation of what the future holds in the way of extractible gold and uranium once full mining operations are under way it is our view that the shares will rally as the business generates its initial revenue stream for additional information visit investor relations solutions is a communications arm of ir solutions profiles investor relations solutions is not

mahaffey glas craft i like the new look of the industry forum mark w south carolina i m sick of all this garbage about covering foam with a thermal barrier what the hell do you think foam is if you are saying that anything that can be forced to burn should be covered with a fireproof barrier then you d better get busy covering all those trusses and joists and plywood up there that are definitely not carrying a class one fire rating this double standard for foam is coming directly from those who stand to lose business from it icynene is different it doesn t burn alone it doesn t melt it doesn t emit phosgene does it smoke in a fire situation sure so what blaming foam in the attic for a house fire because it forces the foam to eventually burn is about as stupid as blaming foam seat cushions for burning when a gas tank ruptures and burns up a car get real inspectors you want us to cover up the only thing in the attic assembly that doesn t burn as for the vaunted r rating system it is totally bogus the test is designed to make porous insulations appear to perform better than they actually do measuring only conduction and ignoring convection and radiant to convective transfer the test should have been thrown out for the industry lackey it is years ago along with that obsolete fiberglassgarbage they re still selling everybody there s a reason they don t make refrigerators

completely legal just read the next few paragraphs and see what you think if you like what you read great if you don t read it again because you must have missed something as seen on national television making over a half million dollars every months from your home for an investment of only us dollars expense one time thanks to the computer age and the internet be a millionaire like others within a year before you say no way read the following this is the letter you ve been reading about in the news lately due to the popularity of this letter on the internet a major nightly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of the program described below to see if it really can make people money the show also investigated whether or not the program was legal their findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in this program this has helped to show people that this is a simple harmless and fun way to make some extra money at home and besides even if you never got involved in the program the reports themselves are well worth the money they can help you start and advertise any business on the internet that is these reports stand alone and are beneficial to anyone wishing to do business on the internet the results of this show have been truly remarkable so many people are participating that those involved are doing much better than ever before since everyone makes more as more people try it out its been very exciting to be a part of it lately you will understand once you experience it here it is below print this now for future reference the following income opportunity is one you may be interested in taking a look at it can be started with very little investment and the income return is tremendous this is a legitimate legal money making opportunity it does not require you to come into contact with people do any hard work and best of all you never have to leave your house except to get the mail simply follow the instructions and you really can make this happen this e mail order marketing program works every time if you put in the effort to make it work e mail is the sales tool of the future take advantage of this non commercialized method of advertising now the longer you wait the more savvy people will be taking your business using e mail get what is rightfully yours program yourself for success and dare to think big it sounds corny but it s true you ll never make it big if you don t have this belief system in place multi level marketing mlm has finally gained respectability it is being taught in the harvard business school and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between and of all goods and services will be sold through multi level methods this is a multi billion dollar industry and of the millionaires in the u s made their fortune in the last several years in mlm moreover statistics show people become millionaires everyday through multi level marketing you may have heard this story before but donald trump made an appearance on the david letterman show dave asked him what he would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch without hesitating trump said he would find a good network marketing company and get to work the audience started to hoot and boo him he looked out at the audience and dead panned his response that s why i m sitting up here and you are all sitting out there with network marketing you have two sources of income direct commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you introduce to the business residual income is the secret of the wealthy it means investing time and money once and getting paid again and again and again in network marketing it also means getting paid for the work of others the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers fortunately sometime later i reread everything and gave some thought and study to it my name is jonathan rourke two years ago the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down sized and my position was eliminated after unproductive job interviews i decided to open my own business over the past year i incurred many unforeseen financial problems i owed my family friends and creditors over the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just couldn t seem to make ends meet i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business at that moment something significant happened in my life and i am writing to share that experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially in mid december i received this program via e mail six month s prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities all of the programs i received in my opinion were not cost effective they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year it didn t tell me i d have to write a book to make it but like i was saying in december i received this program i didn t send for it or ask for it they just got my name off a mailing list thank goodness for that after reading it several times to make sure i was reading it correctly i couldn t believe my eyes here was a money making phenomenon i could invest as much as i wanted to start without putting me further into debt after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out i would at least get my money back but like most of you i was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all so i checked it out with the u s post office hrs and they confirmed that it is indeed legal after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter i decided why not initially i sent out e mails it cost me about for my time on line the great thing about e mail is that i don t need any money for printing to send out the program and because all of my orders are filled via e mail the only expense is my time i am telling you like it is i hope it doesn t turn you off but i promised myself that i would not rip off anyone no matter how much money it cost me here is the basic version of what you need to do your first goal is to receive at least orders for report within weeks of your first program going out if you don t send out more programs until you do your second goal is to receive at least orders for report within weeks if not send out more programs until you do once you have your orders relax you ve met your goal you will make but keep at it if you don t get right off keep at it it may take some time for your down line to build keep at it stay focused and do not let yourself get distracted in less than one week i was starting to receive orders for report i kept at it kept mailing out the program and by january had received orders for report my first step in making in days was done by january had received orders for report more than i needed so i sat back and relaxed by march of my e mailing of i received with more coming in every day i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car please take time to read the attached program it will change your life forever remember it won t work if you don t try it this program does work but you must follow it exactly especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place it won t work you ll lose out on a lot of money in order for this program to work very fast try to meet your goal of orders for report and orders for report and you will make or more in days if you don t reach the first two goals with in four weeks relax you will still make a ton of money it may take a few months or so longer but keep mailing out the programs and stay focused that s the key i am living proof that it works if you choose not to participate in this program i am sorry it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you if you choose to participate follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security if you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble like i was or you want to start your own business consider this a sign i did sincerely jonathan rourke p s do you have any idea what bills look like piled up on a kitchen table it s awesome a personal note from the originator of this program by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports you should have concluded that such a program and one that is legal could not have been created by an amateur let me tell you a little about myself i had a profitable business for years then in my business began falling off i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me but it wasn t working finally i figured it out it wasn t me it was the economy inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since i don t have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate because many of you know from first hand experience there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before the middle class was vanishing those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up those who did not including those who never had anything to save or invest were moving down into the ranks of the poor as the saying goes the rich get richer and the poor get poorer the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to move up or get rich inflation will see to that you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life with no risk and just a little bit of effort you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined follow the program exactly as instructed do not change it in any way it works exceedingly well as it is now remember to e mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of one of the people you send this to may send out and your name will be on everyone of them remember though the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach so my friend i have given you the ideas information materials and opportunity to become financially independent it is up to you now think about it before you delete this program from your mailbox as i almost did take a little time to read it and really think about it get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it you will still make a lot of money you will definitely get back what you invested any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in it works jody jacobs richmond va here s how this amazing program will make you thousands of dollar this method of raising capital really works every time i am sure that you could use up to or more in the next days before you say no way please read this program carefully this is not a chain letter but a perfectly legal money making opportunity basically this is what you do as with all multilevel businesses we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multilevel business partners and we offer a product for every dollar sent your orders come by mail and are filled by e mail so you are not involved in personal selling you do it privately in your own home store or office this is the greatest multi level mail order marketing anywhere this is what you must do order all reports shown on the list below you can t sell them if you don t have them for each report send cash the name number of the report you are ordering your e mail address and your name return address in case of a problem make sure your return address is on your envelope in case of any mail problems when you place your order make sure you order each of the five reports you need all five reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them within a few days you will receive via e mail each of the five reports save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the s of people who will order them from you important do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report or their order on the list in any way other than as instructed below in steps a through g or you will lose out on the majority of your profits once you understand the way this works you ll also see how it doesn t work if you change it remember this method has been tested and if you alter it it will not work a look below for the listing of available reports b after you ve ordered the five reports take this advertisement and remove the name and address under report this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their c move the name and address under report down to report d move the name and address under report down to report e move the name and address under report down to report f move the name and address under report down to report g insert your name and address in the report position please make sure you copy every name and address accurately copy and paste method works well take

surely you can afford you obviously already have an internet connection and e mail is free to assist you with marketing your business on the internet the reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e mails where to find thousands of free classified ads and much much more here are two primary methods of building your downline method sending bulk e mail let s say that you decide to start small just to see how it goes and we ll assume you and all those involved send out only programs each let s also assume that the mailing receives a response using a good list the response could be much better also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of but continuing with this example you send out only programs with a response that is only orders for report those people respond by sending out programs each for a total of out of those people respond and order report those mail out programs each for a total of the response to that is orders for report those send out programs each for a total the response to that is i orders for report that amounts to each of bills for you in cash money then think about level five that s alone your total income in this example is for a total of remember friend this is assuming out of the people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half sent out programs instead of believe me many people will do just that and more report will show you the best methods for bulk e mailing and e mail software method placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise let s say you decide to start small just to see how well it works assume your goal is to get only people to participate on your first level placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response also assume that everyone else in your organization gets only downline members follow this example to achieve the staggering results below lst level your members with nd level members from those x rd level members from those x th level members from those x k th level members from those x k this totals remember friends this assumes that the people who participate only recruit people each think for a moment what would happen if they got people to participate most people get s of participants think about it for every you receive all you must do is e mail them the report they ordered that s it always provide same day service on all orders this will guarantee that the e mail they send out with your name and address on it will be prompt because they can t advertise until they receive the report available reports order each report by number and name always send cash u s currency for each report checks not accepted always send your order via first class mail make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two

thing spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved i knew it wouldn t work jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet i made merciless fun of her and was ready to lay the old i told you so on her when the thing didn t work well the laugh was on me within two weeks she had received over responses within days she had received over in bills i was shocked i was sure that i had it all figured and that it wouldn t work i am a believer now i have joined jody in her hobby i did have seven more years until retirement but i think of the rat race and

am i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i wouldn t get enough orders to at least get my money back boy was i surprised when i found my medium size post office box crammed with orders for awhile it got so overloaded that i had to start picking up my mail at the window i ll make more money this year than any years of my life before the nice thing about this deal is that it doesn t matter where people live there simply isn t a better investment with a faster return paige willis des moines ia i had received this program before i deleted it but later i

a better investment than the stock market all our mailings are sent complying to the proposed h r unsolicited commercial electronic mail act of please see the bottom of this message for further information and removal instructions parents of year old find cash hidden in his closet does this headline look familiar of course it does you most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program usa and reported elsewhere in the world including my neck of the woods new zealand his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her year old sons closet nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash five dollar bills twenties fifties and hundreds all neatly rubber banded in labelled piles my first thought was that he had robbed a bank says the year old woman there was over dollars in that bag that s more than my husband earns in a year the woman immediately called her husband at the car dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered he came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet as it turns out the boy had been sending out via e mail a type of report to e mail addresses that he obtained off the internet everyday after school for the past months he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom i just got the e mail one day and i figured what the heck i put my name on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out says the clever year old the e mail letter listed addresses and contained instructions to send one dollar bill to each person on the list then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses down and finally to add your name to the top of the list the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five dollar bills within weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the address list i get junk e mail all the time and really did not think it was going to work the boy continues within the first few days of sending out the e mail the post office box that his parents had gotten him for his video game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines but envelopes containing bills about a week later i rode my bike down to the post office and my box had magazine and about envelops stuffed in it there was also a yellow slip that said i had to go up to the post office counter i thought i was in trouble or something laughs he goes on i went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me i had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all over the next few weeks the boy continued sending out the e mail the money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet barely had time for my homework he had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the bills for twenties fifties and hundreds i didn t want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack i would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me one time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it but i just rode to the next bank down the street laughs surprisingly the boy did not have any reason to be afraid the reporting news team examined and investigated the so called chain letter the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain letter at all in fact it was completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws title section and or title section in the us code also in the code of federal regulations volume sections and which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received every five dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read please send me report number xyx this simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service a report on how to for a five dollar fee this is the end of the media release if you would like to understand how the system works and get your please continue reading what appears below is what the year old was sending out on the net you can use it too just follow the simple instructions be financially free like others within a year before you say bull please read the following this is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately due to the popularity of this letter on the internet a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below to see if it really can make people money the show also investigated whether or not the program was legal their findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple instructions they are bound to make some megabucks with only out of pocket cost due to the recent increase of popularity respect this program has attained it is currently working better than ever note follow the directons below i had best results the second time when i hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions in order for all of us to be successful many many emails must be sent so that the returns are many i have been extremely successful using the following company they send out the offers and all i do is accept money for reports then i send back to the people as soon as possible this is what one had to say thanks to this profitable opportunity i was approached many times before but each time i passed on it i am so glad i finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required to my astonishment i received total in weeks with money still coming in pam hedland fort lee new jersey here is another testimonial this program has been around for a long time but i never believed in it but one day when i received this again in the mail i decided to gamble my on it i followed the simple instructions and walaa weeks later the money started to come in first month i only made but the next months after that i made a total of so far in the past months by re entering the program i have made over and i am playing it again the key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and not change anything more testimonials later but first print this now for your future reference order all reports shown on the list below for each report send cash the name number of the report you are ordering and your e mail address to the person whose name appears on that list next to the report make sure your return address is on your envelope top left corner in case of any mail problems when you place your order make sure you order each of the reports you will need all reports so that you can save them on your computer within a few days you will receive vie e mail each of the reports from these different individuals save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the s of people who will order them from you also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer important do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report or their sequence on the list in any way other than what is instructed below in step through or you will loose out on majority of your profits once you understand the way this works you will also see how it does not work if you change it remember this method has been tested and if you alter it will not work people have tried to put their friends relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money but it does not work this way believe us we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened so do not try to change anything other than what is instructed because if you do it will not work for you remember honesty reaps the reward after you have ordered all reports take this advertisement and remove the name address of the person in report this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune move the name address in report down to report move the name address in report down to report move the name address in report down to report move the name address in report down to report insert your name address in the report position please make sure you copy every name

assist you with marketing your business on the internet the reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e mails legally where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more there are primary methods to get this venture going method by sending bulk e mail legally let s say that you decide to start small just to see how it goes and we will assume you and those involved send out only e mails each let s also assume that the mailing receive only a response the response could be much better but lets just say it is only also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e mails instead of only each continuing with this example you send out only e mails with a response that is only orders for report those people responded by sending out e mail each for a total of out of those e mails only responded with orders that equals people responded and ordered report those people mail out e mails each for a total of e mails the response to that is orders for report those people send out e mails each for a total of million e mails sent out the response to that is orders for report those people send out e mails each for a total of million e mails the response to that is orders for report that s orders times each half million your total income in this example is grand total numbers do not lie get a pencil paper and figure out the worst possible responses and no matter how you calculate it you will still make a lot of money remember friend this is assuming only people ordering out of you mailed to dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one th of those people mailed e mails each or more there are over million people on the internet worldwide and counting believe me many people will do just that and more method by placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response we strongly suggest you start with method and add method as you go along for every you receive all you must do is e mail them the report they ordered that s it always provide same day service on all orders this will guarantee that the e mail they send out with your name and address on it will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report order each report by its number name only notes always send cash u s currency for each report checks not accepted make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least sheets of paper or aluminum foil on one of those sheets of paper write the number the name of the report you are ordering your e mail address and your name and postal address place your order for

and opportunity to become financially independent it is up to you now more testimonials my name is mitchell my wife jody and i live in chicago i am an accountant with a major u s corporation and i make pretty good money when i received this program i grumbled to jody about receiving junk mail i made fun of the whole thing spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved i knew it wouldn t work jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet i made merciless fun of her and was ready to lay the old i told you so on her when the thing didn t work well the laugh was on me within weeks she had received responses within the next days she had received total all cash i was shocked i have joined jody in her hobby mitchell wolf chicago illinois not being the gambling type it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan but conservative that i am i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i wouldn t get enough orders to at least get my money back i was surprised when i found my medium size post office box crammed with orders i made in the first weeks the nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live there simply isn t a better investment with a faster return and so big dan sondstrom alberta canada i had received this program before i deleted it but later i wondered if i should have given it a try of course i had no idea who to contact to get another copy so i had to wait until i was e mailed again by someone else months passed then it luckily came again i did not delete this one i made more than on my first try and all the money came within weeks susan de suza new york n y if you have any questions of the legality of

granted first right of refusal to beckman coulter inc nyc bec to license genethera s patented technology for developing live animal genetic diagnostic tests this is a significant milestone for genethera beckman coulter is one of the world s leading manufacturers of biomedical testing systems tests and supplies our collaboration will unite the expertise of beckman coulter with the cutting edge technology of genethera dr antonio milici m d ph d genethera inc genethera provides genetic diagnostic solutions for the veterinary and agricultural industries with future plans to include the healthcare industry the company was formed to realize the commercial potential of molecular diagnostic assays using roche s f pcr technology to detect the presence of infectious disease from the blood of animals particularly live animals this platform enables genethera to offer tests that are presently not available from any other technology future plans include all infectious disease potentially

kits and services for more information visit www beckmancoulter com we are looking forward to working with genethera to identify commercial applications of their technology chris neary general manager prion business center beckman coulter inc in most countries around the globe the discovery of a cow with mad cow disease leads to the immediate slaughter of hundreds even thousands of cattle out of wide spread fear of disease spread and the need to complete disease testing on the dead animals costly international beef recalls are common since mad cow testing until now has only been conducted after the slaughter process genethera s live animal blood test could lead to halting of mass slaughters and widespread panic while saving the industry hundreds of millions of dollars each year through the testing of a single blood sample genethera could end the need to slaughter entire herds of cattle and other animals for disease testing saving the industry hundreds of millions of dollars each year currently funded by an institutional money manager in southern california genethera has plans to open laboratories worldwide to meet this exploding bse testing demand you want to invest in the

genethera technology genethera s business is based on its integrated technology platform itp that combines a proprietary diagnostic solution called gene expression assay gea tm with purivax tm its system for analyzing large scale dna sequencing the first part of this platform is the ongoing development of molecular diagnostic assays solutions using real time fluorogenic polymerase chain reaction f pcr technology to detect the presence of infectious disease from the blood of live animals the second part of the itp is the development of therapeutic vaccines using rna interference technology it also allows for the efficient effective and continuous testing management and treatment of animal populations these facts distinguish the technology from any alternative testing and management methodology available to agriculture today all of which require the destruction of individual animals and even entire herds our testing and data analysis processes also allow us not only to separate infected from clean animals but also to gain knowledge vital to development of preventative vaccines genethera inc is committed to providing global access to cutting edge biotechnology

to detect mad cow and chronic wasting disease a disease affecting elk and deer in north america diagnostic assays for e coli ol h and johnne s disease are in the final stages of development vaccines for e coli ol h and johnne s disease both of which are diseases affecting cattle are in advanced stages of development in the future the company plans to expand assay application research to a wide range of diseases animals the immediate targets being mad cow hoof mouth west nile and newcastle genethera can detect bse using the companies patented live animal blood test that evaluates the e d r f gene sequence the e d r f gene is proven to decrease dramatically before any tse infection is noticeable in a live animal or human the patent gtha holds is broad based and can detect all tse diseases including mad cow bse in cattle cwd in elk deer and creutzfeld jacobs in humans the company s patented test can detect these diseases faster than any other method developed in the marketplace and at far less a cost the test can also be used on a mass scale using roche f pcr dna analyzing robotics equipment genethera can analyze over blood samples a day with one f pcr machine and a single technician the project will prove highly profitable at approx per test when wide scale commercialization is under way a multi billion dollar international demand for commercial mad cow testing has emerged around the globe japan conducted million post mortem rapid mad cow tests last year alone they used the western blot developed by prionics ag in swizterland and bio rad s rapid test costs are between and dollars per test most importantly other tests in the marketplace cannot detect the disease until the animal has been killed testing through post mortem brain tissue exams is extremely labor intensive and costly japan spent between million million on million post mortem rapid mad cow tests in genethera s simple blood test can be collected using their patented field collection system the sample is then mailed to the lab for testing the company also stated in their recent k that they are currently in negotiations with strategic testing partners that we believe will absorb the costs

re wall street micro news report homeland security investments the terror attacks on the united states on september have changed the security landscape for the foreseeable future both physical and logical security have become paramount for all industry segments especially in the banking national resource and government sectors according to giga a wholly owned subsidiary of forrester research worldwide demand for information security products and services is set to eclipse b by homeland security investments is a newsletter dedicated to providing our readers with information pertaining to investment opportunities in this lucrative sector as we know events related to homeland security happen with lightning speed what we as investors can do is position ourselves in such a way as to take advantage of the current trends and be ready to capitalize on events which have yet to happen homeland security investments is here to help our readers do just that with this in mind it is with great excitement that we present vinoble inc this stock is expected to do big things in both the near and long terms symbol vnbl current price short term target price month target price why we believe vnbl ob will give big returns on investment at this time much of vnbl s focus is on rfid radio frequency identification technology this is technology which uses tiny sensors to transmit information about a person or object wirelessly vnbl is already an industry pioneer in the rfid personal location technology vnbl is developing a form of rfid technology which allows companies and governments to wirelessly track their assets and resources such technology has huge potential in the protection and transportation of materials designated high risk were they to fall into the wrong hands vnbl works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in order to create high security space in locales where it is deemed necessary locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports sea ports mines nuclear facilities and more as with all stocks news drives the short term price fresh news has made vnbl a hot buy news on vnbl malibu calif business wire june vinoble inc otcbb vnbl news a holding company seeking to identify long term growth opportunities in the areas of homeland security security information systems and other security services announced today that it plans to offer products and services that will assist in the automation of the identification and control of equipment assets tools and the related processes used in the oil gas and petrochemical industries although small wirelessly networked rfid sensors can monitor machines and equipment to detect possible problems before they become serious they can also deliver safety features within oil wells oil maybe trapped in different layers of rock along with gas and water detection of specific liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur such as a well filling with water as with other rf based technology applications rfid can also provide the safe transit of materials by only the authorized handler and limit the entry of personnel to specific locations ensuring personnel safety is essential should there be an emergency at a facility rfid tags would enable the customer to track and evaluate its employee s safety and or danger this application technology requires product and hardware that can operate in harsh and potentially hazardous conditions but gives valuable safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer rfid can also assist the customer s supply chain by tracking oil gas and chemical products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retail level vinoble s viewpoint as previously stated is that these applications are more than just a valuable tool to the mining industry but as a protective measure of our country s natural resources and commodities against threat preservation of these fuels and resources is important to the safety of u s industry and economy the company believes that such offering service and technology application in the oil gas and petrochemical industry will further position vinoble in a rapidly expanding industry while taking advantage of access to the increasing capital and global spending that the company will require for growth the company s goal is to also provide a much needed service at a cost manageable to even the smallest of businesses that can t afford to do without the safety of its personnel and assets in

reduction in road accidents august dear sir madam in case you have received this mail earlier kindly ignore this mail it may have been re sent to you by mistake ours is not a mailing list and we have no intention of sending any regular mails to anybody we have devised a set of systems which can reduce the damage caused to vehicles and deaths and injury caused to passengers and pedestrians in vehicular accidents by more than seventy five percent we have already filed and are in process of filing further multiple and appropriate disclosure documents provisional patent applications at the united states patent trademarks office uspto and also applications under the patent co operation treaty at world intellectual property organization wipo at geneva there is absolutely no doubt that our idea is new and innovative moreover we are very confident and very sure that this will help reducing minimizing human suffering to a very large extent there is no doubt that the product devised by us will change the face of the earth forever brief details relating to our product are detailed in the annexures under the following headings statistics advantages options economics we are looking for the followings business consultancy and advice regarding the most viable practical and profitable course of action under the circumstances and also consultancy on patents one person moderately injured every three seconds one person mildly injured every three seconds c current yearly automobile sales worldwide more than billion us d number of automobiles worldwide more than billion pieces e daily loss caused due to vehicular accidents worldwide more than billion us per day of the worldwide gross national product of more than billion us more than us per year more than billion us per day theadvantages of the technology developed by us a the introduction of such technology will dramatically reduce the expenses of auto insurance this reduction of insurance cost will be at par with or even more that the expenses incurred towards the introduction of such technology in modern day vehicles accordingly the life insurance premier will also undergo drastic reduction additionally because of saving of lives the outgo of the insurance companies will reduce substantially b as per the who studies and projections road accidents occupy the number nine positions by way of causes of death in the world today it is projected by who that by the year they will occupy the number three positions next only to heart disease and depression by introduction of this technology we are sure that this will not happen on the contrary there will be massive reduction in the number of deaths due to road accidents and road accidents may not figure on the list of major causes of death in the year at all c this technology will therefore make all vehicles cheaper and safer not only will the cost be reduced safety which is priceless in itself will also be greatly enhanced as and when the regular patent application is filed and patent is granted the life of the patent will be years even at the current levels with road accidents placed at number nine on the who list as a major cause of death there is a daily loss of two billion us even at the present level over a period of twenty years without any interest and without any compounding this loss works out to be billion us x days x years billion us d our technology will ensure that at least seventy five percent of the above losses are prevented such figure works out to be more that billion us it is important to note that this is the projection at the current level as per the future projections the incidents of road accidents are expected to increase hence the figure is likely to be increase very substantially in addition the time factor and the interest factor will inflate this figure further e at the current levels more than million persons are dying every year due to road accidents even at the current rates more than million lives will be lost in road accidents over the next twenty years i e life of the patent when granted besides at the current levels million people are injured every year in the next twenty years the number of people injured due to road accident will therefore be more than half a billion f if we add to that the personal physical and psychological traumas to those directly involved in and also to those who are associated with the people involved in the road accidents the trauma and the misery and henceforth the value of the savings are all unmeasurable in quantities presently known to human kind g considering the figures and dynamics as explained hereinabove it may not be improper or out of place to compare this technology with the introduction of electricity computer or aircrafts in terms of its value to mankind h the benefits of this technology will be so obvious and essential that in the very near future the use of this technology will become unavoidable it should and will become mandatory by law to install such technology and the installation of such technology should and will be a pre requisite for granting or renewal of the registration and license of all vehicles in future i as described hereinabove this technology and its utility are incomparable outthought of and unheard of till date it will open a new floodgate in human travel and safety measures in future it can and will be applied to other mode of transport like aircrafts and trains also among other things we have the following options available to us options available to us a outright sale a immediate outright sale of the idea and the concept along with our filed applications for one time lump sum consideration b further development of the concept and further filing of patent and all patent related applications before taking steps as outlined in a the process b will obviously increase the realization in terms of price b licencing options i new vehicles granting of licenses to manufacturers of automobiles individually or collectively all over the world for incorporation in the automobiles to be manufactured in future on fixed time or per piece basis ii conversion of existing vehicles to independent agents for conversion of the existing more than billion vehicles all over the world c combined options a collaborative arrangement with some private and or government agency wherein we receive a certain down payment and then jointly distribute the licensing rights on a pre decided sharing partnership arrangement the economics of the project will be as follows in case any all processes and systems described by us are incorporated in the design of new vehicles and the new vehicles are manufactured in accordance with the modified designs the cost escalation may not be more than to and the safety and the protection will be ten times more than the price escalation hence drop in insurance premier will compensate for the cost escalation in case the existing vehicles are modified the cost involved will be approximately to of the value of the vehicle but partial modifications at a lower cost which will give partial protection may also be carried out as a thumb rule the cost of modification in percentage terms will be about one fifth of the percentage of safety and protection provided in case the value of the vehicles is low or the life of the vehicle is about to expire the partial modifications may be practically and economically viable as incorporation onto a new vehicle is relatively less expensive and more protective there are more than billion motor vehicles in the world at present besides there are an unspecified number of non motorized ehicles almost all of them can be converted in phased manner to a variable degree the cost of conversion will be directly proportional to their current market value and the safety shield to be generated there from among the motorised vehicles the conversion cost may work out of few dollars for every percent of safety shield created the exact calculation can be worked out but over all some of the methods may provide more safety at lower cost compared to the other which may differ in efficiency even if we consider a very vague and approximate cost of conversion of us per vehicle the conversion industry works out to be worth billion us realising the potential of the product in terms of human safety it will be reasonable to presume that majority of such conversion will be completed over a period of three years from the starting date as pointed hereinabove the size of the conversion industry may be estimated to in the range of billion us per year over the next three years alternatively considering the diversity of available motorised vehicles all over the world conversion licensing can also be commercially viable proposition for such conversion licenses can be granted on line on receipt of on line payments in that case different rates for granting conversion to vehicles having specific registration numbers can be granted in accordance with and in proportion to the size carrying capacity and the engine power of the vehicle in case licensing is done the creation and installation of the concerned systems will be done by the end user as per his circumstances and needs however piracy is likely to be a major problem in such licensing it is likely that as and when the systems are introduced in the motorised vehicles unusual and unprecedented demand of new vehicles is created this will result in massive rejection of the vehicles currently playing all over the world and stimulate an entirely new market as far as motorised vehicle is concerned the size of such market is difficult to either comprehend and or estimate p s some of the figures have been rounded off but generally the figures are correct we have tried to keep this communication brief and to the point more details including website references are available with us and can be provided if required,1

shares wi skyrocket price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bull market in a generation natural gas prices have tripied in the last two years with multipie projects in high gear and the expanding production on reserves worth muiti miilions eogi is selling for less than the vaiue of its assets emerson oi and gas speciaiizes in using new technology to turn unproductive oi and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises already shares in the oi and gas sector are rising faster than the overa market in fact four of dow jones ten top performing industry sectors for the past year

dollar new markets and is expected to generate very significant recurring income with patented technology products to gain competitive advantage strategic partners are willing to integrate vspc s products on a worldwide basis future vspc cost effective growth is based on the fabless business model perfected by the semiconductor industry which for example outsources wafer manufacturing to the far east strong management team a strong management team is the most important critical ingredient to creating future shareholder value vspc has a strong management team see below large rapidly growing markets in general to increase shareholder value a company must participate in rapidly growing markets and should try to be a significant player in targeted markets vspc expects to dominate billion dollar markets that do not exist today by introducing believe it or not technology innovations that create and expand markets breakthrough products in the vspc pipeline vpsc products in the

total breakthrough with a nanotechnology based mass spectrometer is a portable carry on suitcase size device that processes identifies one molecule at a time further miniaturization is expected to shoebox size compared with stationary desk size provided by today s competitors significant recurring income from fuel cell batteries in five years annual revenue from disposable fuel cartridges for fuel cell powered portable electronic devices is expected to range between billion on the low side to billion on the high side that market does not exist today vspc s fuel cell cartridge business model is similar to the well known razor razor blade model which is to sell the razor and then make much more money on the recurring blade business the fuel cell is a razor and the disposable fuel cartridge is the razor blade another analogy is the flashlight battery model imagine if a company had the primary intellectual property involved in manufacturing flashlights it would probably license that technology to major flashlight manufacturers in return for help in dominating the recurring flashlight battery business in this case vspc has the proprietary rights to the flashlight the fuel cell and intends to sell the flashlight battery specifically disposable fuel cartridges for an end user price of each vspc is currently negotiating to provide its patented fuel cell technology to major computer manufacturers in return for their agreement to use disposable fuel cartridges developed by vspc the manufacturing of which will be outsourced to well known major plants in the far east intellectual property protected with patents vspc s fuel cell technology for example is protected by over issued and pending patents strategic partners lend credibility to create a cost effective worldwide footprint emerging companies must partner with branded global companies who have strong management teams and significant resources vspc is partnering with major well known market leaders who have management resources and global branding partners are attracted to vspc s technology and expect to gain competitive advantage by integrating patented proprietary technology obtained from vspc for example in the fuel cell business toshiba nec sanyo hitachi and samsung have unveiled prototype fuel cell powered products that more than double the operating time over existing battery technology

global relevance by leveraging unique expertise not available elsewhere in the commercial world viaspace sees a compelling business opportunity in the homeland security public safety and fuel cell markets viaspace target markets are in excess of b yr and growing with a cagr of over in the past six years viaspace has created three companies spectrasensors qwip technologies and vialogy corp their websites provide a background on the commercialization of nasa technology spectrasensors com qwip com vialogy com the company s current focus is on three subsidiaries direct methanol fuel cell arroyo sciences and ionfinity direct liquid methanol fuel cell direct methanol fuel cell corporation dmfcc will provide disposable methanol fuel cell cartridges for tomorrow s fuel cell powered portable electronic devices such as laptop computers and cell phones methanol fuel cells dfmc are expected to replace lithium ion batteries in portable electronic devices a dfmc can power a laptop for up to hours on a disposable cartridge that costs to a smaller cartridge can power a cell phone for up to weeks we believe consumers will spend a few extra dollars for the convenience of keeping their cell phones and other electronic devices operating as a disposable product it generates recurring revenue for dmfcc the technology is protected by over issued and pending patents toshiba nec sanyo and samsung have unveiled prototype fuel cell powered products that more than double the operating time over existing battery technology dmfcc has opened a tokyo office to work closely with japanese manufacturers arroyo sciences inc arroyo focuses on the fusion of radio frequency nuclear and electromagnetic imaging to deliver information products in transportation supply chain security logistics

clean up additional projects under review projects not included in our forecast are a water purification technology and interactive radio the water purification system displays impressive statistics in that it can convert brackish sewage or industrial wastewater into ultra pure water the water system is scalable from house to municipal usage and will last years while requiring minimal maintenance the interactive radio enables a listener to receive emails or web sites delivered in response to what is broadcast the radio station essentially receives input from listeners that could enhance advertising and improve vertical market focus forecasts and valuation we expect revenues for dmfcc will be driven by increasing wireless usage of computing devices and the existing need to extend cell phone battery life we expect revenues for dmfcc will commence in and grow to million by homeland security expenditures on airport and seaport security will be a primary revenue driver for arroyo sciences which will begin to generate revenues in and will grow to million in we expect commercial revenues for ionfinity will commence in late and will be million in beyond total revenues will grow at a to rate for several years from existing and new products contracting with existing manufacturers we expect operating margins will be in the low range by our initial forecasts indicate a fair

info you requested kcc thank you for your interest judgment coursesoffers an extensive training course in how to collect moneyjudgments if you are like many people you are not even sure what a money judgment is and why processing money judgments can earn you very substantial income if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you will have a money judgment against them you are happy you won but you will soon find out the shocking fact its now up to you to collect on the judgment the court does not require the loser to pay you the court will not even help you you must trace the loser down find their assets their employment bank accounts real estate stocks and bonds etc very few people know how to find these assets or what to do when they are found the result is that millions of judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten in of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a dime the non payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic proportions right now in the united states there is between and billion dollars of uncollectedmoney judgment debt for every judgment that is paid more judgments take its place we identified this massive market years ago and have actively pursued judicial judgments since we invented this business we have perfected it into a well proven and solid profession in which only a select few will be trained in the techniques necessary to succeed with our first hand experience we have built a course which teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown and exciting field of processing money judgments by following the steps laid out in our course and with reasonable effort you can become very successful in the processing of money judgments the income potential is substantial in this profession we have associates who have taken our course and are now working full time making to over per year part time associates are earning between and per year some choose to operateout of their home and work by themselves others build a sizable organization of to people in attractive business offices today our company and our associates have over million dollars in money judgments that we are currently processing of this million million is in the form of joint ventures between our firm and our associates joint ventures are where we make our money we only break even when our course is purchased we make a margin on the reports we supply to our associates our reporting capability is so extensive that government agencies police officers attorneys credit agencies etc all come to us for reports many of our associates already have real estate liens in force of between million to over million dollars legally this means that when the properties are sold or refinanced our associate must be paid off the norm is interest compounded annually on unpaid money judgments annual interest on million at translates to annually in interest income not counting the payment of the principal our associates earn half of this amount or per year this is just for interest not counting principle and not counting the compounding of the interest which can add substantial additional income typically companies are sold for times earnings just based on simple interest an associate with million in real estate liens could sell their business for approximately million dollars of all of our associates work out of their home are women and are part time one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are not under any kind of time frame if you decide to take off for a month on vacation then go the judgments you are working on will be there when you return the judgments are still in force they do not disappear the way we train you is non confrontational you use your computer and telephone to do most of the processing you never confront the debtor the debtor doesn t know who you are you are not a collection agency simply stated the steps to successful money processing are as follows mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals with money judgments we train you how to find out who to write to to of the firms and people you write will call you and ask for your help they call you you don t call them unless you want to you send them an agreement supplied in the course to sign which splits every dollar you collect to you and to them this applies no matter if the judgment is for or you then go on line to our computers to find the debtor and their assets we offer over powerful reports to assist you they range from credit reports from all three credit bureaus to bank account locates employment locates skip traces and locating stocks and bonds etc the prices of our reports are very low typically to of what other firms charge for example we charge for an individuals credit report when some other companies charge once you find the debtor and their assets you file garnishments and liens on the assets you have located standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the course when you receive the assets you keep and send to the original judgment holder once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of judgment to the court included in the course quote s from several of our students thomas in area code writes us i just wanted to drop you a short note thanking you for your excellent course my first week part time will net me dollars your professionalism in

read an article in the economist that highlighted online gaming and how it has become a socially acceptable form of entertainment over the next few days as we thought about what sort of impact this trend could have we started to notice that online gambling was being discussed all over the media in newspapers online and on television it became obvious to us that more and more people were jumping on the internet to bet on games we also came across some staggering statistics merrill lynch for example has predicted that gambling has the potential to account for a full of global economic activity

the online gaming industry in other words appears to be booming and it may be an ideal time to is time to invest we decided to find out who the key players were in the business after speaking with a number of industry insiders the trail led us to an emerging publicly traded company called gaming transactions inc ggts after a close look at ggts we decided that this company could produce huge returns on investment in the upcoming months although ggts is a new company it has some surprisingly experienced players at the helm an uncommon thing to find in an industry only ten years old the company has come out with online versions of the addictive game keno and its management team was smart enough to secure the rights to the keno com website which if youre marketing keno is as good as it gets keno has the widest spread for the house of any mainstream gambling game ggts is also about to launch a suite of other online gambling games including poker and sports book betting once it offers these popular games and given that it already has keno com online the company could bring in great revenues attracting a lot of attention in the investment community and driving up its stock price after a successful north american launch gaming transactions inc gtts has translated its games into chinese and is about to hit asia this initiative looks like a wise business decision many analysis anticipate that china will be the biggest source of online gambling revenue by so the company could be poised for massive expansion in terms of both profits and global reach what does all this tell us a brand new company a popular well known game one of the biggest spreads for the house a growing market experienced management and a stock price that is trading under a dollar it adds up
