the only problem i can see with this is that paragraph could be construed to encourage nmng to request amendment not only to increase the maxdtq but also to decrease it if the maxdtq has been increased by a previous amendment i worry that this might mislead nmng that the parties can decrease the maxdtq by agreement rather than nmng using capacity release procedures however the paragraph does not obligate tw to do anything doesn t give nmng any rights since any change in the maxdtq must be by mutual agreement and it s subject to available capacity since it does not seem to give either party anything they do not already get under the tariff i think i would recommend we omit it however nmng might insist on this or similar language to reflect the deal or at least the conversations of the parties if that s the case i suppose i would advise the marketing folks to limit the language of paragraph to an increase in maxdtq and explain that any decrease would have to be thru capacity release comments forwarded by susan scott et s enron on pm christine stokes am to susan scott et s enron enron drew fossum et s enron enron christine stokes et s enron enron steven harris et s enron enron glen hass et s enron enron mary darveaux et s enron enron mary kay miller et s enron enron bill cordes et s enron enron cc audrey robertson et s enron enron subject transwestern contract approval request transwestern contract approval request please review the attached discount letter for new mexico natural gas inc nmng the contract s five year term provides for eot eot receipts and deliveries at a dth day transportation rate the contract s maxdq varies by month and is show on the appendix a of the discount letter please indicate your approval via reply with history officer approvals will be faxed to bill cordes for final officer approval ,0

greg attached is correspondence between marathon and enron megs concerning the revised draft of the lease that i had forwarded for marathon s review and also to you for mariner s review i wanted to give you the benefit of these discussion we have had with marathon concerning how the megs and mariner s responsibilities should be split our intent with these revisions and the our goals as we continue to work with marathon on these issues is to simply allocate the risks between mariner and megs with respect to marathon as mariner and megs intended them to be allocated under the o m agreement between the two we are not asking marathon to rely on the o m agreement to which they are not a party risk associated with ownership of the flowline should run to megs and risk associated with the operation and maintenance of the flowline and ownership of the hydrocarbons should run to mariner as they currently do under the production handling agreement we intend to work with marathon toward this end if you have any comments concerning these discussions or would like to discuss this further with me please contact me at i would also be interested in any comments you may have with respect to the draft lease agreement i forwarded to you earlier thanks gerald nemec ena legal forwarded by gerald nemec hou ect on am bradley g penn bgpenn marathonoil com am to gerald nemec enron com cc ergetz groupwise marathonoil com rahernandez groupwise marathonoil com subject re platform lease reply reply gerald it seems that the drafts that have been sent back to marathon have confused the relationships of marathon mariner and megs as an example you have requested that the lopsa rely on the o m agreement between mariner and megs which marathon is not a party we would rather that agreement remain between megs and mariner and be the basis for your resolution of disputes the legal capacities presented in your response to the lopsa draft are confusing all rights seem to flow to megs yet the obligations seem to be on mariner we do not believe the division of rights and obligations in this manner are a good situation by example the indemnity provisions have been altered to have mariner indemnify the owners and operator no mention of megs and then further change the indemnity to a negligence based indemnity of platform operator the pha is a unilateral indemnity to platform operator and platform owners and we must insist on this same level of protection with megs if you would like to make another attempt at either a ratification or lopsa that addresses megs as lessee and mariner as its operator and provide for any resolution between those two in the o m agreement we would be happy to discuss this further if you would like to go through the lopsa line by line please call and we can set up a teleconference with our legal department to do so bgp gerald nemec enron com pm i have reviewed your response and disagree with the characterization of our modification the documents i would like to clarify our reasons for the modifications to avoid any further miscommunications megs alteration of the documents do not impair the protections afforded to marathon under the production handling agreement our modifications were simply intended to allocate certain risks between megs and mariner with respect to marathon as operator of the south pass b platform as such risks were intended to be allocated by megs and mariner mariner s transfer of interest in the flowline to megs introduces a new party which marathon can look to for certain obligations with respect to the platform the alterations do not remove mariner from its current role as operator and maintainer of the flowline and owner of the hydrocarbons for these reasons i would disagree with your response that the draft alterations do not provide the intended protections that marathon would expect absent such a transfer to megs mariner still shoulders these risks and expenses under the production handling agreement having megs fully ratify the production handling agreement and becoming jointly and severally liable to marathon is not appropriate megs does not hold title to any hydrocarbon production or operate the facilities and should not be liable for all risks and expenses associated therewith mariner should continue to shoulder those risks and as before i would be happy to discuss your issues with our platform lease revisions at your convenience or to discuss the above further bradley g penn to gerald nemec enron com bgpenn marath cc ergetz groupwise marathonoil com onoil com jcalbert groupwise marathonoil com subject platform lease reply  am attached are our response and ratification agreement bgp gerald nemec gerald nemec enron com pm brad can you give me a status on where you are at with the review of the lease docs for the megs facilities i forward those documents about a month back gerald nemec enron north america corp legal see attached file megs doc see attached file megsrat doc,0

davis favors tiered rate increases david lazarus chronicle staff writer sunday march san francisco chronicle url http www sfgate com cgi bin article cgi file chronicle archive m n dtl gov gray davis faced with the near inevitability of raising consumers electricity bills is leaning toward a rate system whereby those who use more power pay more than those who conserve the chronicle has learned sources close to the governor said he is being lobbied by his own staff members to accept a so called structured rate system top officials from his own administration told lawmakers friday that the state may end up spending more than twice the billion previously estimated to purchase power on behalf of california s near bankrupt utilities if so the officials warned that consumers electricity rates could double in the case of pacific gas and electric co this would mean customers average monthly power bills would rise from to consumers throughout the bay area believe that at least some increase is on the way we re going to have to bite the bullet and pay the money said larry webster a retired caltrans worker in redwood city we might as well admit that electricity is no longer a nickel it s a dime if you re going to use it let s pay for it steve maviglio a spokesman for the governor distanced himself yesterday from estimates that rates would double the figures reported in the press he said were wildly high the governor still believes he can live within the existing rate structure maviglio said until we know the results of the negotiations with the utilities you can t conclude anything the state is negotiating a multibillion dollar bailout package with pg e and southern california edison co to relieve the utilities of about billion in debt pg e and edison have been saying for months that there is no way california can overcome its current energy woes without higher rates the irony of the davis administration now saying the same thing was not lost on the two companies the state is in the exact same position the utilities were in last fall said john nelson a pg e spokesman either wholesale prices need to come down or retail prices need to go up the disparity is too large statewide blackouts last week drove home the precariousness of california s energy situation to ratepayers and may have served as a blessing in disguise for the governor cost vs outages if given a choice between further outages and paying higher rates many consumers said they would accept increases in their power bills i don t like either choice said janet leroux facing the possibility of a gooey mess if the air conditioning goes out at her downtown san francisco candy store but i guess i d go with higher rates i sure didn t like the blackouts publicly the governor has been insisting for weeks that rates will stay within the existing rate structure a stealthy way of saying that january s percent increase and an expected percent increase next year will remain in place but privately he and his staff are discussing additional rate increases that could be spread over as long as years sources said utility executives and power generators told the chronicle last week that a minimum percent rate increase lasting up to a decade is in the cards for the good of california it s inevitable said gary ackerman executive director of the western power trading forum a menlo park energy industry association sacramento resident john hax observed that when temperatures soar in the central valley this summer he d be more than willing to pay a higher price for power if this keeps the air conditioners on it s like gasoline he said i don t like paying higher prices for gasoline but that s the price of doing business ratepayers draw the line though at any increase topping or percent if it was percent i d probably do it said tracy resident mark dougherty but if it was more like percent i d rather go with rolling blackouts i d rather have blackouts agreed jenny soghomonian owner of a shoe repair shop in san francisco s financial district i don t want to pay rates that are so much higher not every cost palatable this is the tightrope that state officials and industry players now find themselves walking while consumers may be willing to pay more to avoid blackouts they aren t willing to swallow virtually any cost thrown their way yet if rates are not high enough they may not prevent daily blackout threats this summer and beyond higher rates are the price signal that it takes for conservation said tom higgins senior vice president of edison international parent company of southern california edison simply put he meant that most consumers will not aggressively conserve power and thus alleviate shortages unless there is a financial incentive to do so rebates proposed by the governor have met with only a lukewarm response requiring critics say too much effort on the part of individual ratepayers but a sudden spike in monthly power bills almost certainly would prompt widespread conservation measures it adjusts consumer behavior higgins said people want to get their bills back down rates effect on usage he and other industry sources said higher rates are perhaps the only way californians will achieve the percent conservation goal sought by the governor a move seen as vital if blackouts are to be avoided this summer it s intellectually dishonest to think there s any other way out of this higgins said consumer activists initial reaction to any talk of a rate increase comes across loud and clear no no no no bailout no rate increases no secret deals said harvey rosenfield head of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights in santa monica we need to get back to a regulated system rosenfield is the biggest fly in the governor s ointment he has threatened to push through a ballot initiative re regulating california s power market if davis cannot find a consumer friendly way out of the current fix because of rosenfield s past success in writing a ballot measure on insurance rebates which delivered about million to consumers his threat is taken seriously in sacramento we ve paid too much already rosenfield said a fair price is what we were promised by deregulation which was a percent rate decrease however when he was asked whether there was any room to discuss a structured rate increase such as the idea being promoted by the governor s staff rosenfield toned down his characteristic rhetoric big users should pay more he said after a moment s reflection i m open to a tiered system but only if it s fair rosenfield quickly added that he would have to see how other consumer advocates felt about the matter before agreeing to negotiate such things with davis move toward structured rates clearly though momentum is building toward a system of structured power rates which probably would include increases of varying sizes for consumers the california public utilities commission is scheduled to address january s percent rate increase on tuesday that increase originally was given only a three month duration but most observers expect it to be renewed for at least another three months if not longer puc president loretta lynch declined to comment on the likelihood of rates going up but added her voice to those backing a structured system i am a fan of restructuring rates to exempt conservation she said people who use a whole lot of power should pay more the biggest electricity customer in the state is the state itself now that california is purchasing power on behalf of its cash poor utilities the state already has spent about billion buying electricity and has yet to determine how the cash will be recouped from consumers san francisco resident rosita magee accepts that for california to find its energy footing once more rates will probably be heading up that way you have more convenience and electricity more stability she said but magee has come up with another solution one that doesn t involve rate increases and rolling blackouts she s moving to texas chronicle staff writers matthew stannard and pia sarkar contributed to this report e mail david lazarus at

as i promised this morning at the executive committee meeting below are some talking points for your use overall message the market is working regulation is not in california peak demand rose by over the last years while new capacity grew by only but as you would expect the market responded by proposing mw of new generation more than enough to offset the peak demand growth the regulatory process at both the state and local level has failed to site this new generation the problem is regulation not deregulation when san diego customers began experiencing the effects of higher prices enron responded with a fixed price which would have shielded san diego customers from price volatility and provided prices below their current summer levels enron s price was about mwh after publication of enron s offer nine other companies made offers again the market responded where regulation failed san diego has not accepted any of these offers because of regulatory legislative restrictions on its ability to buy outside of the px i e the spot market in markets where siting is easier suppliers have moved to build additional generation enron built plants in response to the price spikes those plants were planned sited and built in less that months in time for the summer of where regulatory hurdles are lower the market responds the solution to current pricing and reliability issues is more competition not reregulation policy makers should open the transmission grid so that power can get from where it is to where it is needed expedite interconnection of new generation expedite siting of new facilities give customers a choice so that they have better access to demand side solutions also attached is a more detailed discussion of california prepared by jeff dasovich of our san francisco office,0

energy crisis senators dianne feinstein and gordon smith announce partnership in response to the western energy crisis march washington dc senators dianne feinstein d ca and gordon smith r or  today announced an agreement to introduce bipartisan legislation to restore  stability and reliability to the western energy market by directing the federal energy regulatory commission ferc to impose a temporary just and reasonable wholesale rate cap or cost of service based rates the legislation will also require the states involved in this effort to pas s on the cost of the electricity to retail customers however the states wou ld be able to determine how and when this would be done in other words california could choose to use tiered pricing real time pricing or set a  baseline rate above which prices would be passed through we now have a piece of legislation that can fix the broken electricity  market and provide a period of reliability and stability in wholesale energ y costs senator feinstein said ferc has found the wholesale prices being charged in california to be u njust and unreasonable this legislation essentially will mandate that once ferc  makes such a finding the agency will carry out its regulatory role this i s a million a year agency it is there to regulate the energy marketplac e and it should what the federal government can do is to provide a period of  reliability and stability at a time of crisis unfortunately ferc has refus ed to do so california s broken electricity market is a result of a flawed  california law that deregulated wholesale costs but left in place caps on  retail prices this was coupled with a requirement that the utilities dives t themselves of their generating capacity and buy most of their electricity o n the spot market where prices have escalated dramatically in hindsight all  of this came together in a catastrophic scenario so that today california  buys electricity at astronomical prices we believe that ferc needs to act to help restore reasonable costs and stability to this marketplace additionally this agreement addresses the escalation of natural gas transportation costs last february ferc began a two year experiment to li ft the cap on these costs and since that time we have seen the price of natura l gas climb percent higher in southern california senator feinstein  added specifically the compromise legislation would accomplish the following goa ls directs ferc to impose a just and reasonable wholesale rate cap which can be load differentiated based on supply and demand or cost of service based rates in the western energy market western systems coordinating council  including arizona california colorado idaho montana nevada new mexico  oregon utah washington and wyoming addresses the issue of high natural gas transmission costs by reimposing fe rc tariffs for natural gas transportation into california ferc order and  requiring natural gas sellers to declare separately the transportation and  commodity components of the bundled rate for gray market transactions stipulates that the wholesale price cap or cost of service based rate will  not apply to wholesale sales for delivery in a state that imposes a price  limit on the sale of electric energy at retail that precludes a regulated  utility from recovering costs under the price cap or on a cost of service  based rate or precludes a regulated utility from paying its bills establishes that the rate making body of a state can determine how and when  the wholesale rates will be passed on to ratepayers including the setting of tiered pricing real time pricing and baseline rates with respect to the  bonneville power administration bpa will be encouraged to seek to reduce  rate spikes to economically distressed communities while ensuring costs ar e recovered by the end of the next contract period in directs that after the date of enactment utilities cannot be ordered to se ll electricity or natural gas into a state without a determination by the federal energy regulatory commission that the seller will be paid directs that in the event that a state in the western energy market does no t meet the criteria described in this agreement state public utilities commissions in the western energy market can ensure that regulated utilitie s within their jurisdiction meet demand for electric energy in the utility s service area before making sales into any such state establishes that the wholesale rate cap or cost of service based rates shal l remain in effect until such time as the market for electric energy in the  western energy market reflects just and reasonable rates as determined by  the commission or until march whichever is earlier,0

chris this is very well written and will serve the reader well a few comments when i think about the taxonomy of the var models i typically use the classification based on categories a variance covariance method b historical simulation c monte carlo simulation delta approach is the way of representing a position in a nonlinear instrument i would define monte carlo as an approach based on statistical simulation of behavior of all the market prices rates etc and revaluation of the entire portfolio the revaluation may be based on an approximation using taylor s expansion that may involve delta delta gamma delta gamma omega or may be exact based on the same model that produces the mark to market portfolio valuations the main benefit of using the mc simulation in the energy markets is the ability to capture the gapping behavior of the energy markets in a straightforward way i would emphasize that there are attempts to incorporate jumps in the v c model i shall send you the references from home i would mention that historical simulation may break down in the markets that are evolving quickly new instruments for which we have no comparable prices behavior of prices may change as markets mature or de mature for bigger portfolios virtually all methods require some level of aggregation into atomic elemental instruments to reduce the dimensionality of the problem this process may be a source of a big error the computational burden of mc can be reduced through clever preprocessing of a portfolio that introduces no error many swaps with the same underlying can be aggregated into one positions they are portfolios of forwards and they are linear instruments please feel free to use any comment or none vince chris strickland chris lacima co uk on pm please respond to chris strickland chris lacima co uk to vince j kaminski enron com cc subject eprm article dear vince  d you think you might be able to look at this in the next day or so robin is after something by the end of this week  best regards  chris  eprm var doc,0

i agree that we should not be opposing rate caps for small customers and schools but i think we should be pounding on the fact that market participants have been putting offers in front of sdge and

diego three commissioner s were present wood lynch and neeper with duque and bilas participating by phone administrative law judge wetzel was present and a transcript was taken the quasi legislative hearing was the beginning of a record developed for the investigation into the workings of wholesale retail markets this session focused on wholesale markets there will be subsequent sessions on retail issues market structure and other related issues in the future my conclusion from this session is that wood is looking for support for increasing regulatory intervention in the market dan larcamp director of the office of markets tariffs and rates ferc was present he relayed ferc s concern of this matter and a desire to hold hearings in san diego he also relayed that hoecker held a press conference announcing the opening of a investigative proceeding into the operation of the wholesale markets in california which carried with it refund authority the format of the hearing was to respond to pre filed questions developed by wood lynch each member of the panel would respond to the questions and any questions posed by the commissioners the judge or the cpuc attorney no questions were posed by members of the audience yesterday s panel of academics were comprised of dr timothy duane uc berkley dr william hogan harvard dr frank wolak stanford iso market surveillance committee david marcus energy consultant for the coaltion of utility employees dr gene coyle dr jean michel glachant universite paris i pantheon sorbonne the panel was asked to speak as individuals and not on behalf of any institutions they may represent while the purpose of the panel seemed to be to determine that market power was being exercised and that prices were too high and therefore not just and reasonable the panelist stopped short of blaming generators and market participants in behaving illegally the concensus generally was that market power did exist at various times but the mere existence did not constitute bad behavior none with the exception of dr wolak who is in the process of doing a study using recent data as part of his role for the market surveillance committee had done a study there was some discussion though not much of the monopsony power of the utilities i think ultimately the group conceded that scarcity of supply amplified concerns about the exercise of market power as even the increase in gas costs did not fully explain the recent spikes wolak believes that encourage utilities to enter into forward purchases will reduce the exercise of real time market power hogan seemed to be there with sempra s interests in mind he continued to promote expansion of the iso s abilities to dispatch load as well as maintain system reliability there was alot of discussion about forward purchase ability for utilities so as to be less subject to volatile market prices the concerns were also discussed about the appropriateness of a distribution utility making purchasing decisions on behalf of its customers this included discussion of separation of these functions and the default provider role most everyone agreed that rolling back to a regulated market was not feasible without raising other major and serious concerns however there seemed to be support for some interim measures where cost of service regulation may be a good idea and that was during peak periods all agreed that a demand response and price signals are important in the long run although not to the extent currently experienced in san diego today s panel included representatives from sdg e sce and pg e turn ucan and ora while yesterday s panel maintained objectivity as to whether or not generators were exercising market power to the detriment of the system today s panel made no bones about the generators being to blame sce pg e indicated their need for relief for recovery of market costs in excess of the rate freeze sdg e was still on the hot seat for their inaction in hedging any of their supply sdg e brought up their failed pbr proposal and ora and ucan thought that that may be one way to incent the utility to be more responsible with their purchases ucan discussed the governor s direction and the potential for putting rate caps into affect for residential and small commercial he mentioned that c i customers are experience difficulties as well turn raised the need for cost based bid caps and cost based peaking contracts mike florio turn urged against any further divestitute of assets and alleged market concentration on those assets that had been divested in fact turn urged the commission to seek legislation to clarify the commission s authority to order retention of assets neeper urged that part of the solution should be changing the current requirement to use the px as the only authorized exchange although turn disagreed bruno gaillard pm to sf directors edward hamb hou ees ees jennifer rudolph hou ees ees chris hendrix hou ees ees greg cordell hou

williamson act passed the senate it should be heard at the assembly saturday or monday if it is not redirected to a committee hearing there was a long meeting with ducheny with regards to ab the enviro s boycotted they want to draft a bill with keeley labor was obstructionist they wanted to gut all the expediting siting language with regards to all facilities except for the peaking plants rate cap related bills the edison language on rate stabilization may not go anywhere edison has not found an author because of the efforts of enron and others lobbying against it furthermore there are signs that gov davis opposes it the governor s office has issued a proposed language for a rate cap bill the language however is not available as of yet it may be released today or tomorrow sdg e has shown concerns over the content of the bill they seem to think that it is worse than initially proposed by the governor in his press release the bill includes retroactive rate caps through the rate cap could reflect wood s rate cap proposal cts cap on the energy component the bill does not specify who or how the costs associated with the cap will be recovered the reasoning is that udcs will be more cautious in their procurement if there is uncertainty on who is responsible for the costs all of this is speculative we hope to see the actual language soon enron has been working with the republican leadership to promote a rate cap proposal similar to the amended language we have proposed for ab the bill focuses only on sdg e customers and our major principals are the following the interim rate cap should be limited to residential and small commercial customers plus specific institutions that have a significant public role such as schools and hospitals the interim rate cap should be limited to the period ending december the interim rate cap must be structured so that any undercollection is eventually recovered from the same customers who benefit from the lower rates provided by the rate cap,0

re isda enron europe i suggest we all get into a room and discuss this i agree with john that we need to start tailoring our documents to the local market but as brent says within the confines of what is legally acceptable instead of just using europe as an example and then rebutting with this is enron policy let s analyze the issue in detail though we are the only players now this will not last for long as the brazilian argentine economies recover i do not understand why we have to work in english jf brent hendry am to john j shoobridge enron development enron development cc michael

poole enron development enron development mark taylor ect sara shackleton enron development rodolfo freyre enron development enron development federico cerisoli enron development enron development subject re isda enron europe john i would be very interested to see what the local derivatives market is developing my guess is that the document is probably being prepared for transactions between two argentine companies if this is the case i would also like to know what is being done on the tax side by the association to fix the tax problems caused by doing swaps in argentina if the argentine association of derivatives has a draft we would like to study it also are we going to become a member of this association and are we going to send someone to the meetings regularly do we have any brochures or other information regarding the makeup of the association from my conversations with mark taylor i do not think that isda has any plans to implement a spanish language isda master the translation process of the master the schedules and all of the various definition books would be a serious undertaking there are literally hundreds of pages of documentation that would have to be legally translated and most us companies that make a market in derivatives products would not have the legal and back office personnel to negotiate and process masters and transactions in spanish i know that ena does not have the capacity to do this at the moment i think the only other language isda is published in is japanese and that is a restricted format used only between two japanese companies for a limited number of types of trades specific to the japanese market english will likely remain the language of choice in international transactions such as what we are doing now between ena and argentine counterparties if the tax situation in argentina were to change and esa sets up its own trading entity in argentina with front back and middle offices then the language issue could be assessed locally i wish there were a simple answer to the current situation please keep me updated in any local market information you come across thanks brent john j shoobridge pm to brent hendry

aguilar enron development enron development julian poole enron development enron development mark taylor ect sara shackleton enron development rodolfo freyre enron development enron development federico cerisoli enron development enron development subject re isda enron europe i m in the need of informing the whole team that argentina through the argentine association of derivatives has developed a document that s circulating in the market and will surely be optimised to the extent that argentine companies will use it in the near future if not inmediately this document has been prepared by experienced groups of professionals with foreign support on terms of credit and legal issues my impression is that will be competing against that document in a great deal of disadvantage this disadvantage will be a cultural disadvantage from the moment that latin american countries tend to have shorter documents written in the local language where the transaction is taking place if the isda was at least written in spanish rather than french or german it would be of great help this is an issue that really tickles me why isn t the isda document translated into spanish being that it is after english probably the language most spoken through out the globe and second that there s much more opportunity of selling risk management products to latin american countries rather than french companies through my more than disappointing experience in trying to close a deal with french total i believe sara s visit would be more that important i ll try to forward everybody a copy of the document that was drafted in argentina for everybody s info i strongly believe in the matters of evolution and i m sure that in the future esa s market will mature in such a way that will just like enron europe a document to match market s needs,0

unfortunately mathematical analysis of skew is extremely hard to do the question is why does skew exist and does the market do a proper job of correcting for violations of the black scholes model in my mind there are three big reasons for skew one is that the assumption of stochastic volatility as a function of price level gets violated commodities tend to have long range trading ranges that exist due to the economics of supply and elasticity of the demand curve nat gas tends to be relatively stable when we are in that historical pricing environment however moving to a different pricing regime tends to bring volatility an options trader wants to be long vol outside the trading range believing that a breakout of the range leads to volatility while trying to find new equilibrium supports a vol smile theory in addition in some commodities realized vol is a function of price level nat gas historically is more volatile at than at and more volatile at than thus there has been a tendency for all calls to have positive skew and all puts except weenies to have negative skew the market certainly trades this way as vol has a tendency to come off in a declining market and increase in a rising market to test regress day realized vol versus price level and see if there is any correlation second reason is heptocurtosis fatter tails than lognormal distribution predicts supports vol smile theory easy to test how your market compares by plotting historical one day lognormal returns versus expected distribution third is just supply and demand in a market where spec players are bearish put skew tends to get bid as vol players require more insurance premium to add incremetal risk to the book if you have a neutral view towards market or believe that market will come off but in an orderly fashion enron can take advantage of our risk limits by selling more expensive insurance crude market tends to have strong put skew and weak call skew as customer business in options is nearly all one way producer fences if you believe vol is stochastic in the region of prices where the fence strikes are can be profitable to take other side of trade if you want to discuss further give me a call pm houston time hope this helps john sharad agnihotri pm to mike maggi corp enron enron john arnold hou ect ect cc subject gas implied volatility smile john mike i work for the london research team and am looking at some option pricing problems for the uk gas desk dave redmond the options trader told me that you had done some fundamental research regarding the gas implied volatility smiles and may be able to help i would be grateful if you tell me what you have done or suggest someone else that i could ask regards sharad agnihtori,0

however littlechild as jeff already knows has been asked to present his paper to a seminar conference in california and to a tokyo research institute much of his travel is paid for but he was not being compensated for his time in making these trips given that his message is one we want to get out into the marketplace of ideas i have agreed to pay him for one day of his usual professional rate fees each for san francisco and tokyo in turn he has offered to come into our offices your offices to meet with you discuss his research and to learn more about your business and your issues may i suggest that if you are interested and i think this is a worthwhile way to exchange ideas views that you just contact him directly referencing that you work with me and i passed along his offer i will be sending to each of you a copy of a monograph i have on the paper i am not sure if it is the full piece of work for your information and future reference nick after meeting him you might inquire as

sure whether you received this message and whether the proposed support is acceptable to you i received only your subsequent comment that vat is no problem i need to give an answer to berkeley and tokyo before i leave in a few hours time regards stephen original message from stephen littlechild littlechild tanworth mercianet co uk to mark schroeder enron com sent wednesday october pm subject re retail competition in electricity dear mark  thanks for the very helpful quick word last night i welcome your support to make it possible to give the talks at berkeley and in tokyo  you asked for details of the second event the organiser is katsuhiko suetsugu and the event is a symposium on electric and gas competition policy november i am forwarding to you a copy of the invitation that sets out the details it mentions that ferc comissioner bill massey has been invited and i understand that he has now accepted  kh has also arranged for me to speak at a breakfast meeting the next day of the tokyo energy policy club tepc this is an informal private group with eighteen members consisting of senior executives and experts in energy and related fields in japan tepc was formed in february and is co hosted by mr yoshihiro sakamoto president of the institute of energy economics of japan and myself the objective of tepc is to provide the members with opportunities to meet and exchange views with leaders of international communities for energy environment international currency and security  as regards support for the two trips i explained to you that i have some offers of contributions to travel expenses in whole or part for each one but there are no fees for these talks and the time necessary to travel and deliver them would be significant this would especially be the case if i combined them which would be necessary to cover total travel costs to sf but then i face additional accommodation costs in between and more importantly dead time for almost three weeks anyway these are my problems but i think it would make it possible for me to accept the invitations if enron were to provide some support how about the following commissioning two days of advice discussions one each in san francisco and tokyo at my standard commercial rate of o pounds sterling per day total o i don t need to take up your colleagues time to this extent but a discussion with them would be useful to fill in the picture perhaps you would let me have their names and contact addresses as you said we can talk later about possible longer term arrangements  as agreed i am posting you a hard copy of my paper you have the original on my previous email the one below but in case you would like to see the nature of my argument i am attaching here the two page summary  i look forward to hearing from you with best wishes stephen original message from mark schroeder enron com to littlechild tanworth mercianet co uk sent friday september am subject re retail competition

electricity    dear ralph  i have just written a paper on retail competition in electricity arguing that joskow hogan and ruff and california have got it all wrong both in theory and in practice it is forthcoming shortly in the dae and judge institute working paper series at cambridge but i thought you might like to see a copy now attached  this is obviously a hot issue in california at present and this morning i received an invitation to participate in a debate there in november copy forwarded separately it seems that enron is also to be invited i have no other commitments in the us at that time is is something that enron might be interested in supporting or for that matter developing further  we spoke some time ago about the common carriage consultative working group at ofwat i did in fact aprticipate in that along with kyran hanks it was a real eye opener to see how little awareness there was of the basic conditions conducive to competition like separate businesses and accounts i m not sure whether enron is pursuing this now or not no doubt lots of other things going on  i should be interested to hear from you on retail competition i am copying this to mark schroeder and kyran

the haircut notion i believe arises from edison s claim that the px price includes a capacity payment particularly when demand i e the price is higher i think there s discussion of it in the proposed decision that came out some time ago and which sits in hold limbo on the commission s agenda i ve attached it alan could you see if it s included in the decision if not i can poke around more thanks best jeff alan comnes ect pm to paul kaufman enron com jdasovich enron com cc subject px based srac payments to qfs jeff paul i talked to mike etringer and found out that the reason why he wanted to talk to jeff is mike s recollection of a conversation with jeff that a srac haircut in the range had been suggested based on the total amount of load in california about to mw jeff is there anything we can point mike to to better understand this basis of a capacity adjustment in our call with doug kerner last week the best guess summed up by calger was that srac would go px based beginning in with a capacity clipping of half way between sce o and iep of however i think mike is struggling to justify a smaller haircut thus the follow up call to jeff alan comnes,0

the senate the assembly and the governor are either poised to engage in very difficult negotiations or the three are about to crash and burn and edison s going to be left dangling in the senate the senate bill xx is with about likelihood going to be voted out of the senate tonight without a vote having taking place in any committee burton announced during one of the two informational hearings that this is it despite the view of just about everyone who appeared before the committees the bill likely won t prevent edison from going bankrupt the key features of the bill are banks and qfs get paid in full edison shareholders would be responsible for debts owed to suppliers no direct access there are conflicting reports about whether the senate will take up the bill tomorrow de linking the bonds from the dwr contracts and whether the republicans will go along with it in the assembly the committee is hearing the wright and hertzberg bills as we speak with hertzberg s the likely winner that bill now provides for direct access under certain conditions the amendments describing the conditions were faxed today we re attempting to get the july date changed to the effective date of the bill or later the assembly likely won t vote the hertzberg bill out until tomorrow at the earliest the problem the assembly and senate bills are diametrically opposed in the way each approaches the problem in short the bills are two ships passing in the night the democratic leaders governor hertzberg burton aren t talking and burton hasn t expressed any interest in talking to anybody the likely outcome given the circumstances burton says he s done what he needs to do i e passed out a fair bill the assembly and senate can t agree they finish the budget time runs out they leave friday and edison s left twisting that said there s still a chance that the governor could call burton and sit down with burton and hertzberg and work something out by friday or begin talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out but given burton the chance of that happening seems very slim in short little has changed since yesterday best jeff,0

justin i note that the eta has been revised to include a paragraph which provides that enron s electronic records will prevail over a signed confirmation is that how we want this to work in the

taylor hou ect ect cc subject internet trading internet trading access and electronic trading agreements mark look forward to your views on the comments expressed by cc as well as their minor drafting changes i have not as yet sent this sullivan cromwell may be you would wish to do this as you see fit look forward to seeing you soon in a week or so justin forwarded by justin boyd lon ect on  enron capital trade resources corp from nicola garrett cliffordchance com  to jboyd enron co uk cc lkitching enron co uk ekapralo enron co uk aaziz enron co uk christopher millard cliffordchance com timothy hughes cliffordchance com bcc justin boyd lon ect subject internet trading internet trading access and electronic trading agreements further to our meeting yesterday please find attached a copy of the internet trading access agreement itaa and the electronic trading agreement eta marked up with my suggested changes from an english law perspective as i mentioned to you yesterday these documents will also need to be considered by the overseas lawyers to see whether there are any overriding local laws which could impact on the use the overseas lawyers have copies of these agreements and will include this in their report i understand that it is envisaged that the itaa will be signed off line and the eta will be posted on the website each person authorised by a counterparty with a password must click through the agreement before commencing trading this will only be done on one occasion we discussed yesterday the risks associated with this approach namely that a counterparty could claim that at the time of entering into the itaa it was not aware of the terms of the eta and therefore could not be bound by it it is clearly important to have certainty that the terms of the eta are enforceable as they contain important terms such as indemnities limitations of liability etc having said that the view might be taken that by entering into the itaa all that has been achieved is that a counterparty receives a password which enable the counterparty to put itself in a position where it must consider the eta before proceeding once the counterparty accesses the website and sees the eta a second contract is made and the itaa and eta must then be read together but only at the time that the counterparty has clicked through the eta i suspect that this is the approach that sullivan cromwell had in mind it is also worth bearing in mind that a counterparty may ask for the eta at the time of entering into the itaa or may be relunctant to click through the eta until they have had internal legal sign off this may delay trading nonetheless i understand that you are keen to proceed with signing the itaa off line and the eta on line and accordingly the attached documents are marked up with that structure in mind as agreed yesterday i have only made changes to the document produced by sullivan cromwell where i think it is necessary for english law purposes or clarification i have the following brief comments on the changes i have made parties you will see that both documents are entered into by a designated enron entity for itself and on behalf of all enron group undertakings the reason for this is that transactions will actually be made between the counterparty and various different enron entities we therefore need to ensure that such transactions with each of those enron entities are governed by the terms of these documents i note from your e mail yesterday that it was suggested that we need to list the affiliates or have one entity enter into the transactions i think there may be some confusion here this is not the case i assume that the current enron entities which trade certain commodities with certain counterparties will continue to do so on the website the website will need to be set up in such a way as to achieve this but i assume that this causes no problem as each counterparty will see different pages on the website depending on what password has been inserted the documents now contemplate this services i have removed the references to services as i am not sure what this means i would have thought that these agreements need to govern the counterparty s access and utilization of the website whether or not they actually carry out any transactions therefore i believe that where the agreement had previously referred to services it can now refer to access and utilization of the website contract formation i have inserted a short paragraph in clause of the eta which provides that a transaction will only be executed once enron generates a message of confirmation of the sale and purchase to a counterparty and that any electronic records of enron will prevail i note that sullivan cromwell envisage a document being attached which explains this this is also acceptable data protection on reflection it will be more appropriate for relevant data protection wording to be on the website itself rather than in the itaa or eta this is because the data protection concerns revolve around data subjects i e living individuals rather than corporate entities such as the counterparty before providing appropriate wording for this could you please let me know what information will be collected by you concerning living individuals either intentionally or unintentionally for example when a password is entered will you be able to identify a living individual by this or can you intentionally or unintentionally obtain that individual s e mail address or other information on them once they have entered the site you will need to check this with your technical people once you have had a chance to review this perhaps you could let me have your comments i have simultaneously sent this e mail to my financial regulatory colleagues for their review they may have further comments which we will send onto you as a matter of urgency kind regards andrew wilkinson enronagc doc enronagmu rtf tradingagc doc tradingagmu rtf

i was planning on changing the morning meeting as you indicated the problem with the p l loss is one of time we have given back million this quarter and very few traders took profits at any time i expect traders to lose money at times but we have other constraints i d be happy to have a call with you once we finish our budget process about how we will get to our numbers next year of course spread trading is a good idea but when i look at the portfolio in aggregate the position story i m being told doesn t make sense we ll get there chris mahoney pm to jeffrey a shankman hou ect ect cc john l nowlan hou ect ect don schroeder hou ect ect david j botchlett hou ect ect ross koller lon ect ect subject re the issue of making the morning meetings more inspiring is a challege we need to take up i would suggest we move to traders telling what the main positions are in their books max and then give a bullish max to bearish max view of their mkt if we moved more quickly through this we might have time for more meaningful discussion at the end i think that the discussion at the end we can keep flexible but for instance when we have major issues like spr sales or an opec meeting we should delegate somebody to do a review of that in terms of the wed meeting unless there is something special i would recommend letting the new research analyst we have hired in london do a quick api review the issue of high volatility in the markets makes a good argument for lowering position sizes but the issue of not having any money to lose won t ever go away i base that statement on the premise that with the budget for next year set at million we will always be under pressure to meet budget and not give back any profits the books that have historically made the most money in enron global products have been more spread trading view oriented rather then flat price momentum oriented i know you would prefer we move away from this and become more the latter but i would encourage you to consider the fact that we have little edge in forecasting short term price movements but hopefully have enough staying power and experience to position ourselves correctly for the big moves from jeffrey a shankman to john l nowlan hou ect ect don schroeder hou ect ect david j botchlett hou ect ect chris mahoney lon ect ect ross koller lon ect ect cc subject it seems to me we are in the middle of no man s land with respect to the following opec production speculation mid east crisis and renewed tensions us elections and what looks like a slowing economy and no real weather anywhere in the world i think it would be most prudent to play the markets from a very flat price position and try to day trade more aggressively i have no intentions of outguessing mr greenspan the us electorate the opec ministers and their new important roles the israeli and palestinian leaders and somewhat importantly mother nature given that and that we cannot afford to lose any more money and that var seems to be a problem let s be as flat as possible i m ok with spread risk not front to backs but commodity spreads the morning meetings are not inspiring and i don t have a real feel for everyone s passion with respect to the markets as such i d like to ask john n to run the morning meetings on mon and wed thanks jeff,0

thanks sue fyi this new schedule was discussed a lot last week and apparently was a big part of the meeting that occured with davis people and angelides last thursday nite it was a move to buy time to try and get a comprehensive settlement in place in the legislature i e core noncore in addition to buying time to save direct access it also gives angelides more time to get the bonds lined up which seems to be an increasingly challenging task there s growing speculation that the issuance will be much more difficult than angelides has thus far let on that said i need to check around but there is some chance that the plan agreement is that the puc decisions would go out well in advance of august with effective date being august which would then provide enough time to let the expedited appeals process under sb run its course in time for the issuance in sept oct in short we ll need to remain vigilant energized because there s a chance that the decisions to which angelides refers in the memo could be up at the commission sooner rather than later this is what i was hearing last friday but perhaps things have changed and now there s more time i ll check and report back finally simultaneous with those actions folks are supposed to be putting the core noncore agreement into legislative language i ll report back as soon as i have more information on that best jeff susan j mara am to michael tribolet enron enronxgate james d steffes na enron enron richard shapiro na enron enron harry kingerski na enron enron jeff dasovich na enron enron paul kaufman enron enronxgate karen denne corp enron enron cc subject angelides investor memo timetable update says cpuc vote not needed until mid august the memo to investors says that a new law will take effect on aug that puts in place shortened appeal times at the cpuc the memo says that the cpuc does not need to act on the key issues including suspension of da until aug or later it also says the bonds are now to be sold in sept oct the memo states that the cpuc governor treasurer etc have agreed with the new timetable sue mara enron corp tel fax forwarded by susan j mara na enron on am manuel erica erica manuel edelman com am to allen stevan stevan allen edelman com arem arem electric com douglas oglesby e mail e mail doao chevron com fairchild tracy tracy fairchild edelman com jeffrey hanson e mail e mail jeff hanson phaser com joseph alamo e mail e mail jalamo enron com megan beiser megan beiser edelman com robert morgan e mail rmorgan newenergy com warner jami jami warner edelman com cc subject fw investor memo timetable update i just received this document from angelides office it s a memo outlining a revised timetable for the puc actions required for the bond sale fyi em original message from philip angelides calif state treasurer mailto philip angelides treasurer ca gov sent tuesday july am to fitzpatrick charles subject investor memo timetable update please note the update regarding the state of california dwr power bonds provided in the attached memo investor memo timetable update pdf if you have any questions please contact charles fitzpatrick at  investor memo timetable update pdf,0

plan would have biggest customers pay edison s debt greg lucas sacramento bureau chief thursday may san francisco chronicle url http www sfgate com cgi bin article cgi file chronicle archive m n dtl sacramento legislative leaders are drafting a new rescue plan for southern california edison that would put the utility back on its feet financially at the expense of its biggest customers the plan would leave manufacturers refineries and other big industrial customers with the burden of paying nearly all the utility s billion back debt through a dedicated charge residential and small commercial users would be on the hook for only a fraction of the back debt big users say it is unfair to saddle them with all of edison s debt but supporters of the plan say it s these users that wanted deregulation and should shoulder the costs it created we re trying to put something together in a way that solves all these problems and if people are to be pigheaded about it we won t solve any problems said assemblyman fred keeley d boulder creek santa cruz county although the plan is an alternative to gov gray davis proposed deal to put edison back on its feet financially it could be used as a model to help restore pacific gas and electric co to solvency democrats say the plan contains some elements desired by republicans but gop lawmakers object to saddling large business users with edison s debt the plan is based on the way gas customers are divided into core and noncore users separating core users under this proposal electrical users would be divided the same way core users would be customers who use kilowatts or less a month noncore would be those using more than kilowatts out of edison s million customers only would be noncore customers but those customers use about percent of edison s demand for energy core customers would get their power from generators owned by edison long term contracts and alternative energy producers such as wind farms and solar panels on contract with the utility that would mean those customers would no longer be subject to the whims of the spot market which has far higher prices than other sources of electricity large users the noncore customers would be given the right to negotiate to buy their power directly from generators or build on site power plants to make themselves energy self sufficient the plan would be phased in through january to give large energy customers time to prepare for buying power on the open market during that period residential small business and large industrial users would all share in paying off edison s debt but in that burden would shift exclusively to the big users republican lawmakers and those same large users have been clamoring to be given what is called direct access to generators so they can negotiate cheaper rates enron is also backing the idea of cutting loose the largest electricity users because that would create a built in market for the energy the company sells large users who want to remain on the grid could do so edison encouraged sources said edison officials met with lawmakers over the weekend to iron out details of the plan a spokesman for edison said he was encouraged by the talks i haven t seen a finished product or a plan said bob foster a senior vice president with edison they re approaching this in a spirit of goodwill and trying to find a solution big businesses complain that the plan does not work because right now there is nowhere they can buy cheap electricity we re very concerned that separating the core from the noncore means we will experience extreme rate hikes over the next two years said d j smith a lobbyist for the california large energy consumers association when you add blackouts the multiple interruptions of production and another potentially huge rate hike the result would be catastrophic to the economy smith said added dorothy rothrock a lobbyist for the california manufacturers and technology association what s the rationale for the noncore to be paying the entire edison undercollection it sounds to me like just pure politics they don t want voters to pay because they vote consumer advocate smells a rat harvey rosenfield head of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights said he thought the plan would eventually turn into a bailout as business interests muscle lawmakers into pushing some portion of edison s debt onto residential and smaller commercial customers i think it s a trick we ve seen this same tactic used at the public utilities commission where what were supposed to be rate increases for big business end up costing more for residential and small businesses rosenfield said the new plan also does not include the outright purchase of edison s part of the transmission system that loops electricity around the state davis backs buying the lines for billion democrats have insisted that for the state s financial help taxpayers receive something of value republicans have insisted that they will back no proposal that includes state purchase of transmission lines in the new proposal the state would have a five year option to buy the transmission lines for billion the book value of the asset in addition the utility would make billion available to the state to either purchase other assets such as edison s hydroelectric facilities for example or use it in partnership

thanks sandi this tracks very well with my chat with barbara barbara s charcterization of irrelevant arguably makes sense from a customer s perspective but it s very relevant to us though i didn t give barbara the details of why it s so important for us just explained that some of our customers given their contracts with us would get hurt seems that the important take away is that they are actively negotiating the end of the rate freeze customers get hurt from a retroactive end and one freeze will the replaced with another that is prices will continue to be capped going forward despite the end of the rate freeze seems that the critical issue is whether the rate freeze ends next month or next year which is something that we re going to want to follow very closely do we have any information on where the negotiations between customers and the utilities ended up this weekend best jeff sandra mccubbin pm to jeff dasovich na enron enron steven j kean na enron enron james d steffes na enron enron harry kingerski na enron enron cc subject conversation with jeff please get back to jeff or myself on how to respond to barbara thanks forwarded by sandra mccubbin na enron on pm barbara r barkovich brbarkovich earthlink net am to smccubbi enron com cc subject conversation with jeff hi sandi per your request i talked to jeff yesterday early evening i had been in a meeting with keeley wright et al after the hearing jeff s proposal was not entirely clear to me but it seemed to focus on specifying an end date for the rate freeze in the hertzberg bill i noted that the focus of the friday hearing and the subsequent meeting was on how much of the short fall the utilities should be able to recover and agreed that we would probably go from one freeze to another therefore the date of the end of the original freeze is rapidly becoming irrelevant unless it is used to create a back way into the first issue this does not seem very likely right now who knows how this will evolve of course but there is a sense of urgency at least in the assembly take care barbara,0

can you handle forwarded by sara shackleton hou ect on pm larry joe hunter am to sara shackleton hou ect ect mary cook hou ect ect cc subject koch energy trading sara mary koch energy trading inc has contacted me several times over the past couple of weeks in order to request that we change our confirmation procedures currently per the master agreement we send our form of confirmation and they sign and return those to us with the volume being well over deals per day with koch they are now seeing this as cost prohibitive on their end as they are doing all of the work related to confirmations comparing details to their system and return faxing now koch would like to go to both counterparties sending confirms comparing each other s paper to the system and notifying only in the case of discrepancies i suggested to koch that we might try using a system similar to sempra s in which we send our confirms and they return a one page fax which lists our deal numbers and their agreement or disagreement with those deals still they considered this to be very manual on their end and leaves them responsible for notifying of any discrepancies i m sure the legal departments will be getting involved soon so i wanted to get your thoughts on changing our current process before it comes to that thanks joe,0

meeting with governor davis need for additional comments suggestions we met with gov davis on thursday evening in la in attendance were ken lay the governor the governor s staff director kari dohn and myself the gov spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his ideas he would like some additional thoughts from us by tuesday of next week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following monday attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed based on my discussions with several of you as well as some background materials jeff dasovich and i prepared below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals the governor s ideas as well as my overview of the situation based on the governor s comments overview we made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration the gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief more modest than what the utilities are looking for and credit guarantees his staff has more work to do on the latter but he was clearly intrigued with the idea he talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level he also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of california consumers including utility owned generation which he would dedicate to consumers on a cost plus basis and excess muni power which he estimates at mw he foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by and provide some political cover our proposals i have attached the outline we put in front of him it also included the forward price information several of you provided he seemed interested in the buy down of significant demand the state setting a goal of x mw of new generation by a date certain getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and setting up a group of rate analysts and other nonadvocates to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities he was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding ldc gas purchases as already mentioned he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities his ideas the gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously under serious consideration and some of which were mere brainstorming some of these ideas would require legislative action state may build or make build transfer arrangements a couple of generation plants the gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases this was a frequently recurring theme utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost plus basis to consumers municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in california state universities including uc csu and the community colleges would more widely deploy distributed generation expand in state gas production take state lands gas royalties in kind negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for addtional gas supplies empower an existing state agency to approve coordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state either eliminate the iso or sharply curtail its function he wants to hear more about how nordpool works jeff someone in schroeder s group should be able to help out here wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state we made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new in state generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators securitize uncollected power purchase costs to dos jeff again i d like to prevail on you to assemble the group s thoughts and get them to kari he wants to see year fixed power prices for peak off peak and baseload not just the one year strips he wants comments on his proposals by tuesday he would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal he wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues thanks to everyone for their help we made some progress today,0

tues editorial lawmakers failed to respond to energy alarm forwarded by joseph alamo na enron on am joseph alamo pm to miyung buster enron development enron development cc subject sac bee tues editorial lawmakers failed to respond to energy alarm lawmakers failed to respond to energy alarm published feb now that state lawmakers have begun an inquiry to determine what caused california s energy crisis they might want to take a look in the mirror not at the infamous vote that triggered the partial deregulation of the electricity industry the remains of that law have been picked over enough besides most of the people who voted for it have already left the legislature thanks to term limits but there was another vote last june far less heralded and still little known it came just as warning bells were starting to signal the onset of what has since become a crippling crisis the legislature not only ignored those alarms it stood in the way of the people who were trying to respond why it did so remains something of a mystery how it did so says a lot about the way the legislature works at issue was the now defunct california power exchange this was a state mandated auction until recently the only place that utilities were allowed to shop for the electricity that lights our homes and businesses by last june there were ominous signs that the power exchange known as the px wasn t working right prices were higher than anyone expected the supply of energy seemed thinner than was reasonable there were enormous overhead costs the power exchange was a bit like having a single automobile auction where everyone who wanted to buy or sell a car had to do business in times of surplus this might work because the sellers would underbid each other to unload their cars to reluctant buyers but in a shortage the opposite would be true buyers with no place else to go would pay ever higher prices to get what they needed that s what was happening with electricity a majority of the public utilities commission decided to do something about it the puc voted to allow privately formed exchanges to compete with the state sanctioned auction at least two private exchanges were promising to deliver more power at lower prices with fewer administrative costs the commission wanted to let them give it a try but before the puc could even implement the change the legislature intervened acting with unusual speed lawmakers overturned the commission s decision assembly bill was a classic legislative bill in the worst sense a cobbled together collection of unrelated items it was drafted in a hurry as a companion to the new state budget one of the bill s many parts was a provision to subsidize california s film industry that got a lot of attention the paragraph overturning the puc s attempt to head off the energy crisis got next to none the bill was amended in the senate on june and approved later that day the assembly passed it the next day and gov gray davis signed it the analysis of the bill that members saw in the assembly was cryptic and misleading it said the bill would authorize the puc to study the idea of allowing competition for the state mandated exchange that was true as far as it went but the analysis omitted the fact that the bill s real intent was just the opposite to reverse a puc decision and prohibit competing exchanges for at least a year california had made a big investment in the power exchange said sen jim brulte r rancho cucamonga who was one of probably just a handful of legislators who knew about the provision before it became law the puc decision would have put that investment at risk which is another way of saying that the power exchange wasn t working and had to be protected from competition richard bilas the puc commissioner who was pushing the hardest for the reform the legislature overturned said he never liked the idea of mandating a single exchange in which the utilities would have to buy all their power bilas wasn t a member of the commission when the puc restructured california s electricity industry but he said the result reminded him of the former soviet union where leaders declared that they were going to move to a market economy and then appointed a group of central planners to figure out how those markets should function markets are not based on fictitious or created exchanges he said markets are based on buyers and sellers coming face to face to negotiate a deal you don t establish beforehand something that may not be necessary it s still not clear whether opening up the markets would have prevented the price spikes that have since nearly bankrupted the utilities forcing the state to step in and buy electricity to keep the lights on it might be a stretch to suggest that any single policy change could have prevented the crisis but we will never know the legislature acting in haste and with little information kept us from finding out the california power exchange which the legislature was so eager to protect from competition collapsed of its own weight anyway and is now out of business the law preventing other exchanges from entering the market was quietly repealed two weeks ago seven very long months after it was adopted,0

great points teece and the lion s share of the folks on the participants list are advocates of a minimalist role for government particularly where markets are a clear and preferably option as in the case of electricity that said i think we re going to have to make a fundamental decision about what the goal of this study would be which will determine to a large degree whether we choose to pursue it i ll throw out for comment the notion that the study should be designed to serve one purpose to influence the policy decision currently under debate to de regulate or not as such i wouldn t see issues like pjm or apx or competitive default supplier or not or divest generation with vesting contracts or retain the assets being the focus that debate over critically important implementation details would seem to come in round once the initial debate over deregulate or not is won to try to do both i e resolve in the broad policy issue and make the case for the specific right implementation plan would arguably bog the study down perhaps interminably and it seems that time is of the essence in the current environment in addition unless the fundamental policy issue is won and won rather quickly debating implementation may be moot of course it will be impossible to avoid some level of dicussion on how to do it but that would not be the emphasis in sum i d suggest for comment that it only makes sense to proceed particularly since time is of the essence if we focus on the high level policy level question of to deregulate or not and address implementation in a second or follow up study i think we should try to make a call on this swiftly since the go no go decision would seem to flow from resolution of this issue best jeff james d steffes am to jeff dasovich na

subject analysis by academics why de regulation is the right policy choice greetings as i ve mentioned i ve been discussing with a group of academics principally from uc berkeley the possibility of producing an analysis of why it makes sense to move forward toward de regulation and makes no sense to turn back to command and control regulation clearly we re at a fork in the policy road move forward or go back i ve finally gotten a proposal from the group it s attached please take a look i d like to distribute more widely internally for comment but wanted to run it through a preliminary screen to guage whether folks think it would be useful before cluttering up folks in boxes with more emails to read few points worth mentioning the majority of the academics that would do the report are affiliated with lecg inc the consulting group that i worked with prior to joing enron list also includes dan mcfadden uc berkeley nobel prize winner who wrote the recent op ed piece in the wsj the list also includes hogan and joskow and borenstein we could certainly exclude these folks should we choose to go forward with the analysis however the goal is to produce a high level analysis i e de regulation is good and can work command and control regulation is bad and we know that it does not work once the study is released if it is pursued the authors could tour the country testifying before federal and state bodies to advocate the virtues of de regulation and the pitfalls of reversing course the analysis would not be a debate over to poolco or not to poolco pjm etc in this way including folks like joskow and hogan could offer the added benefit of creating a nixon goes to china scenario please take a look at the list of participants again we can add to and subtract from the list laura tyson would be one of the two project leaders the other would be david teece chairman of lecg none of the folks on the list occupies either extreme of the political spectrum it s a mix of d s and r s who are arguably centrist economist and strong believers in markets i won t vouch for joskow and hogan the idea would be to get a wide array of industry participants from across the country to support the project this is for two reasons the more diverse the group supporting the effort the greater the credibility and they are asking for about million to do the study if you think it would be useful to pursue the study as part of our national campaign to minimize the damage created by california i would like to start immediately to approach trade associations companies customers etc nationwide to garner support for the project let me know if you think the effort would be worthwhile appreciate your comments best jeff forwarded by jeff dasovich na enron on pm reaffirming the case for electricity

fyi should be of interest best jeff forwarded by jeff dasovich na enron on am discretionary load curtailment program the california independent system operator iso has created the discretionary load curtailment program dlcp to provide additional resourc es to the grid for the management of potential system emergency conditions  this program provides an energy only payment and gives loads total control  over their curtailments the control that many need to feel comfortable participating in a demand response program the dlcp consists of two parts a day ahead request and a day of request for curtailment the iso will pay load aggregators mwh for demand they offer and curtai l in the day ahead portion and mwh for demand they offer and curtail on  the day of portion this program will act as an umbrella for certain udcs programs under assembly bill ab x and also attracts any other aggregator that can bid loa d curtailments into the program a load aggregator la can be any company w ho enters into a dlcp agreement with the iso because ab x provides payments  for the bundled customers that are aggregated by the udcs an alternate agreement will be made with them regarding procedures of operation non ud c load aggregators will receive the performance payments from the iso through  their elected scheduling coordinator the dlcp will operate year round during the hours of am until pm fr om now until december the need for this program will be evaluated  throughout and implemented for if needed some provisions includi ng trigger mechanisms and payments may be re evaluated and changed based on summer experience the iso is accepting proposals from those interested in being a load aggregator starting on march xx and continuing until the end of this  program for more information and a copy of the request for proposals plea se visit our web site www caiso com clientserv load this will be posted aft er the dlcp is approved the dlcp is intended to provide the iso with demand curtailment from loads  that may not be able to participate in the iso s participating load prog ram ancillary services and supplemental energy or the iso s summer de mand relief program however contracted drp loads may participate in the dlcp  during months outside of the drp period additionally existing udc interruptible customers that have met their yearly contractual obligation m ay participate this new program is intended to allow end use loads to participate through a load aggregator in a curtailment program while givi ng those loads total discretion whether to participate in any day the program is activated by the iso key features of the dlcp feature dlcp availability march xx december minimum load aggregator portfolio mw curtailed energy payment day ahead mwh day of mwh curtailment window am pm dlcp request day ahead request upon iso projecting a need for demand response the iso may call on this  program based upon the best available temperature load and resource forecast information for specified hours of the next day the dlcp day ahead request will be issued by pm day of request upon iso projecting a need for demand response the iso may call on this  program based upon the best available temperature load and resource forecast information for specific hours on that day the dlcp day of request will be issued by am dlcp offer las shall respond to the dlcp

aggregated with other customer s must sign a dlcp agreement must have an iso approved performance measurement process must be capable of interacting with the iso s dlcp infrastructure as well as communicate with the end use load customer must nominate an sc for settlement transactions with the iso dlcp end use load customer in order to be eligible for the dlcp an end use load customer must be able to provide a net reduction in demand that meets the criteri a of the la or the local regulatory authority must have an interval meter approved by the local regulatory authority or have the appropriate measuring device s as required by the approved la s performance measurement process must be located inside the iso control area ask your la if you are not  sure must not concurrently participate in the iso s summer drp howev er may participate during months outside of the drp contracted period may september if the end use load is a udc interruptible customer the customer may

offered under the dlcp must obtain and provide positive proof of all necessary permits of operation or approvals from the local air pollution control district or air  quality management district for each individual generating unit designated  for participation in the dlcp dlcp process dlcp request dlcp day ahead request the iso will project the need for demand response the iso may call on this  program based upon the best temperature load and resource forecast information available by pm the day ahead the iso will issue a dlcp d ay ahead request by e mail to all contracted load aggregators the e mail notice will request the curtailment amounts for two hour blocks within the  iso specified curtailment timeframe the iso will provide any constraints in the notice dlcp day of request the iso will project the need for demand response the iso will base this  projection upon the best temperature load and resource forecast informati on available by am of the day of the request the iso will issue a dlcp da y of request by e mail to all load aggregators the e mail notice will reque st the curtailment amounts for each two hour block requested the iso will provide any constraints in the notice dlcp offer by pm on the day ahead the load aggregators will submit to the iso  through the iso dlcp website their committed amounts of load curtailment  the iso expects that the load aggregators will have contacted the end use  loads in their program to determine how much curtailment will be available  and for which hours of the day by am of the day of the load aggregators will submit their committe d amounts of curtailment dlcp confirmation once the iso reviews submitted dlcp offers iso operations will issue an e mail notice to both the load aggregators and their scheduling coordinator s accepting specific dlcp offers the iso will issue the dlcp confirmation  notice by pm on the day the day ahead request was made and by am fo r the day of requests these confirmation notices will request that the load  aggregators communicate to the end use loads the required curtailment amoun t and duration this will be the only communication dispatch to the load  aggregators detailing the curtailment dlcp performance the effectiveness of the dlcp will be based on the performance of each end use load in curtailing their confirmed curtailment amount the iso expects that the committed curtailment will occur based on the hours as confirmed through the dlcp confirmation notices an aggregator has the responsibility to produce the demand reduction it confirms there is no se t penalty except that continued poor performance could result in revocation of the dlcp agreement performance measurement guidelines the measurement of performance for each end use load will be performed by t he load aggregators each load aggregator will have an iso approved performan ce measurement plan which will be used to calculate the dlcp performance th e performance measurement plan shall include the following for interval metered end use loads the load aggregator will calculate a  baseline load profile dlcp performance will be measured by the difference  between baseline load profile and the meter read for the hour s of curtailment for non interval metered loads dlcp performance will be calculated by using a combination of sample measurements historic data process controls  use of data loggers and any other performance measurement method approved by the iso load aggregators shall obtained iso approval prior to offering dl cp for non interval metered end use loads it should be noted that the iso  favors interval meters dlcp settlement each dlcp offer for which a dlcp confirmation was issued by the iso shall b e uniquely identified therefore dlcp day ahead and dlcp day of offers must  be separately identified the load aggregators except for the udcs shall  submit the dlcp performance measurement for each confirmed offer by using t he dlcp website no later than days following the operating day of the dlcp  curtailment the iso will calculate the performance payment by simply multiplying the dlcp energy price mwh for dlcp day ahead and mwh  for dlcp day of by the amount of dlcp in mws for each hour of confirmed  curtailment for each month the performance payments will be summed up for  all the confirmed curtailments and paid to the load aggregator s nominat ed scheduling coordinator the payment will be made to the scheduling coordinator in accordance to the iso payment calendar timeline the iso recognizes that udcs acting as load aggregators will have specific  rules to follow for the settlement of the dispatched curtailment the udcs  will be responsible for following the settlement rules and regulations set  forth by the cpuc for the end use

considering brazilian court versus icc arbitration michelle blaine pm to jgardine skadden com drosenbl skadden com cc john novak sa enron enron bruce lundstrom enron development enron development richard b sanders ect robert c williams enron development enron development subject cuiaba call legal issues consent issue jose bestard he s the main developer who did this deal reported that he met with furnas this week furnas had not received epe s letter addressing the consent issue furnas continues to link its failure to sign the consent to commercial exposure to the high price from the mae there are initials on the original consent and no one including furnas knows whose they are john novak told me he s not sure of the significance but it is not uncommon in brazil to initial documents nevertheless we need to ask our brazilian lawyers whether there is any significance under brazilian law keep in mind also that consent document was between epe and the assignor electronorte arbitration considerations bestard has a meeting planned with the ambassador he consulted enron s financial business consultant in brazil winston fernino sp who advised that we should exhaust all political avenues before resorting to litigation or arbitration what concerns me however is his advice that politically it is not the time to seek assistance fromthe president for the consent that there is a political battle in the senate and that we should wait until the end of february to seek political assistance my view on that is to wait more weeks to progress with this notice of default when the day cure period has expired plus the day extension which has also expired sends the wrong message and weakens our position thus it is my recommendation that we proceed immediately with a notice to terminate under clause paragraph of the ppa which then requires a day consultation period paragraph at the end of which we have the option to terminate this buys us a little time but keeps the pressure on at the end of which we can initiate proceedings to compel the consent or to terminate i m not sure what reaction the notice to terminate could bring about from furnas i m not sure how that plays out in our settlement with siemans consider also that the commercial people are not comfortable with termination yet i am not sure what rights if any we waive by waiting around doing nothing or how that may affect our position in arbitration or litigation something we need to look at under the contract although i cannot immediately recall any deadlines or express waivers related to timing in this regard i committed that we would advise the team on the next call next thursday our recommendation with respect to arbitration litigation i want to make sure they understand every possibility so they can make an informed decision you have the matrix developed already if you want to expand on that or handle that your own way bestard opines that furnas will fight hard that they have traditionally been very adversarial and uncooperative i ll find out who represents them force majeure furnas is also taking a very strong position that epe does not have a valid force majeure claim based on my reading of the contract our facts appear to fit squarely under clause c however i m told we did not comply strictly to the notice terms we ll need to show that we were not negligent as a cause for the attorney general s action laine powell president of the cuiaba companies will gather the information on our force majeure claim and we need to consider the legal issues related to our position note that if fm lasts more than consecutive months both parties have the right to terminate no one buys the plant and we re stuck i ll find out the date of our last fm notice there have been several budget lets consider what it will cost to nail down this arbitration concern and give initial advice on how to proceed over the next week what it will cost to prepare for arbitration and the cost of the arbitration darren i ll call you tomorrow and we can break that out we may want to consider the litigation route we ll need to put together some kind of proposed or potential time line and what will happen in each stage and tie a number to it i ve done this with pete before and he seems to like it it needs to be subject to review as we go along next prep for the call and get a recommended strategy in place i m going to get together all our opinions on the brazilian state of arbitration and get a conference call with one of these experts so we can get the best advice we certainly have some conflicting views our experience in the brazilian courts is that nothing happens and we could be stuck for years so i am inclined to take our chances with arbitration and we may get stuck in the court anyway if we go to court perhaps furnas would take the position that we must arbitrate that is what fernando serec said who knows please give me your comments or just call me i m open to any suggestions john novak will be able to tell us about all the competing concerns that i may be unaware of with any strategic plan regards michelle,0

daniel diamond hou ect ect cc subject from today s ngi enrononline market power under fire the simmering pot of market concerns regarding the market power of enrononline finally boiled over in public yesterday at chicago s ldc forum a representative from enrononline had to fend off verbal attacks from competitors and from the audience who criticized the system as giving enron the ability to manipulate prices and provide it with an unfair advantage over competitors scott coleman an official at altra energy technologies said proprietary systems like enrononline and systems being developed by a consortium of large market players represent a danger to the health of the energy industry because of their current or potential market power altrade operates its own independent online exchange that is one of enron s biggest electronic competitors it differs from enononline in that various buyers and sellers trade with each other with altrade serving to clear the transactions on enrononline enron posts bid and asked prices and is a party in every transaction the proprietary enrononline trading system has been accused of market manipulation mainly because of its tremendous growth since going live last november and because of the market strength of its operator enron corp enron is the energy industry s largest marketer trader risk manager and one of the largest natural gas pipeline operators about of its marketing and trading business today is done over the enrononline system critics charged that enrononline provides a tremendous advantage to its parent because all of the transaction data is thrown into a historical database that is available only to enron enrononline has handled more than transactions worth billion since going live the proprietary system handles about transactions every day with a value estimated at billion and most of its online business is natural gas and power sales and purchases why has the system been so successful it s free easy to use low risk and there is a tight bid ask spread both enrononline and its competitors note there s no special hardware required everything is on the web and a transaction is as simple as a couple clicks of the mouse it also provides a broad variety of information including prices on products and is supported by the largest energy marketing firm although there are many other systems out there few if any have the content ease of use and price discovery of enrononline critics claimed that power enables enrononline to soak up liquidity in the marketplace and in doing so give itself a tremendous advantage over its competitors with each trade enron gains a little bit more information about its competitors positions in the market over the long term i think the market will always correct itself said altra s coleman but in the short term i think if any one player has enough of a presence in any one market they can cause prices to move in one direction or another enrononline director bob shults said the company is simply providing a service for our customers particularly a bid and ask but i don t think enron has the ability to move markets we are just putting a bid and ask out there and if people want to buy at our prices then fine if people want to sell at our prices fine then sell it i don t think we have the market manipulation capability people suspect we are not bigger than the marketplace when asked specifically about historical data collected on those who use the system shults denied the company studies the buying and selling patterns of its competitors with an eye toward manipulation sort of the big brother of the energy marketplace the historical information is not available enrononline s shults admitted we just started calculating the indices and price reports we are now providing that information to the market so everyone else has that information as well he said enron does not retain information about those who use its system shults did however warn that the system will make the u s energy market much more closely connected to the global marketplace in the future with increasing demand for lng imports and rapid price discovery of worldwide commodities on enrononline for example market activity in africa and the far east could have a more immediate impact on domestic markets quoting analysis conducted by forester research inc shults also

hey what the heck is zero week i might be interested in signing up for that pack in some quick credits for my pre grad school work i figured out i m going to essentially have to get a second bachelor s degree before going to grad school but hey it s all about the credentials man as in being able to tell people at my year high school reunion that i have two bachelor s degrees a master s and a rhodes scholarship to study italian wine in a th century villa surrounded by buff tan and unusually good looking farm workers tres important so yeah maybe we ll hold off on the visit for now i think it s more important for us both to feel mentally stable about our finances for right now then we party i could maybe make it out there in april overlap with mom s trip i don t think i could handle the whole thing with her i ll keep it in mind and yeah she s giddy about this whole house move thing i hope it works out for the best i really think it will i m starting to feel really bad about leaving kitty with her but i m in a weird situation with amber s cat at our house already part of me wants to just bring kitty over and tell everyone to deal with it because it s my house too but the other part of me doesn t want to deal with the bloodshed that will ensue between her and amber s outmatched feline oh well i m thinking about it the most excitement i ll be having this week is my haircut with brett tonight i think i might also be purchasing a bedskirt a totally extraneous and disappointing expense that i would never have had if i hadn t insisted on getting a real house with a real bed and all that other crap that goes along with it and inevitably costs you money that you could have otherwise spent on beer and as the sands flow these are the days of our lives i m so impressed with your dating maneuvers i told amber and molly about it last night at dinner which we ate together around our new dining room table and they both said in unison like sister like sister i guess i have some kind of reputation for ending up on dates with waiters go figure anyway it s time for me to go find something to eat and then come back to my desk and consume it while it flows directly to my butt can t wait write back soon kate anna symes annas cobs edu on am to kate symes enron com kate symes enron com cc subject re i m so glad to hear everything s better at your house i totally want to come visit but my last two paycheck deposits have only raised the balance to so it may be awhile i m definitely coming in june when i take a zero week class in eugene mom s supposedly coming out here in april and we might go to glenwood springs hot springs spa massages you should come too fun female family bonding time i am so excited for dad to visit not just because of the car but also because it will increase my quantity of social engagements by about i m a little worried about the effect it s having on mom who asked me when he was coming so she wouldn t run into him like i would allow that to happen how stupid does she think i am but it sounds like she s pretty stoked about this house thing so i m excited for her i have a date with that waiter guy tonight but i m not really that excited because i am fat ugly and on the third day of my period did i mention broke and car less i think i should just put off this whole dating thing until i increase my net value to use kate speak which is just ground zero for most people i am trying to pay off some debt dad took care of most of it but i didn t have the heart to show him my nordstrom account it s slow going though and car payments will not make it easy but seriously this city is so pedestrian unfriendly that i feel i have no choice i tried to go to my tennis lessons the other day and ended up walking along the shoulder of a highway for twenty minutes and every person in denver feels the need to own a dog and allow it to bark menacingly at every passerby i am so afraid of dogs after my brush with death in the form of a doberman so i need a car and i don t care if it means weekly visits to the plasma donation center i actually met marky s ex the other night maybe don t mention to amber i don t know why but the whole thing seems weird and i would rather stay out of it anyway she is really cool she reminds me of my friend jen sturmer except less anorexic and depressed speaking of have you been going out in portland a lot i miss veritable quandary i haven t found anything like that here yet downtown has some cool bars but you have to pay plus an appendage to park and cabs are not cheap either my neighborhood has some good dives like the one on our corner that has a flickering neon sign outside announcing don s mixed drinks not sure but think that s the name of the bar i went in once and met don the king of multiple body piercings here in denver okay i m rambling time to get back to work which is so good lately by the way i get to start grant writing this month hope all s well for you i ll give you the dirt on my date later if my acne doesn t scare him away in minute one miss you love you love yo sista original message from kate symes enron com mailto kate symes enron com sent tuesday march pm to annas cobs edu subject re dearest anna my most favorite sister of them all i m sorry i ve been so bad about staying in touch while you ve been stuck in those rocky mountain highs and lows of life it sounds like things are going really well though rocky mountain highs and that you ve made it through most of the tumult of moving to a new place rocky mountain lows amber tells me every time she talks to marky her man of the hour he mentions how they ve got to get together with you when she comes to town which will be on next friday whoo hoo party i m so mad that she gets to go and i don t being that i am not like her in my eighth year of college and therefore do not enjoy such things as spring break mania anymore and monica tells marky who tells amber who tells me that she d love to hang out with you more often it sounds like you guys had a ball at dinner eh so you ve got options girlfriend which is worlds more than i can say for my life at the mo it pretty much consists of working eating and sleeping i m definitely looking into that sad mental disorder thing because i think it s got me in its clutches but the recent abundance of sunshine has brought me enough renewed energy to start thinking about life after winter we re doing lots of gardening cooking and decorating at the house it s like having three martha stewarts all working together only slightly less stylish immensely less efficient and drunk other than that i ve been trying to organize and simplify my life taking care of mounds of paperwork paying off debts sorting out all those nagging little post it notes that plague me constantly and demand my attention in vain i m actually starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel like maybe i could buy a car or take a trip in a few months or even buy a second pair of shoes but let s not get wild and crazy just yet so i heard dad and laura are on their way to your neck of the woods with an automobile that is in the immortal words of the guys in dude where s my car sweet dude you are stoked i bet that s a major load off just make sure to keep your finances in check and not get in over your head take it from one who knows

to the list of issues we need to jointly think through df lorraine lindberg pm to drew fossum et s enron enron kevin hyatt steven harris et s enron enron cc tmonaldo mrg llc com subject richardson testimony this gets ugly richardson says fbi has determined drives did not leave los alamos june web posted at pm edt gmt by ian christopher mccaleb cnn washington two highly sensitive computer hard drives that were missing from the los alamos national laboratories earlier this year never left the premises and the fbi has uncovered no hints of espionage in the case energy secretary bill richardson told a senate committee wednesday energy secretary bill richardson the two hard drives each smaller than a deck of playing cards held vital nuclear weapons secrets and were stored in a secured vault at the storied new mexico nuclear weapons laboratory in a statement opening a lengthy and touchy hearing of senate armed services committee richardson said based upon the investigation by the fbi so far there is no evidence of espionage nor is there evidence the drives have ever left los alamos richardson added that the fbi seems to be on the verge of reconstructing what happened to the drives saying latent fingerprints were found on the scene and on the external wrappings of the drives themselves the fbi continues to comb the crime scene a room housing a copy machine and a grand jury has been convened richardson said punctuating his statement with a declaration that a handful of so called los alamos x division employees have offered conflicting statements to investigators the secretary speculated that the disappearance of the hard drives may have been an unintentional mistake by a lab employee who feared coming forward when alarms were raised i will not take disciplinary action until i have all the facts before me he said vowing i will not rest until i know what happened when where why and by whom the fbi has said the drives disappeared at the tail end of march of this year march richardson said should the fbi s timeline prove correct reports issued at the beginning of this week that the drives have been missing since january could be called into question the two hard drives were discovered missing on may when weapons scientists took an inventory of the drives stored within a vault at the laboratory s x division as a massive wildfire approached the facility the section is perhaps the most sensitive area of the facility and is where the most classified nuclear weapons research design and development is undertaken the scientists had been tasked with checking to assure that all of the division s drives were safely within the vault in the event that the lab would have to be evacuated an evacuation was ordered the next day because of the fire threat but no one reported the drives missing until may sparking a massive search of the area and deep anger in washington the drives contain vital information on the makeup of u s russian chinese and french nuclear weapons they mysteriously reappeared last friday in a room at the lab that already had been searched several times richardson taken to task early and often richardson s pledge to bring accountability to bear on those responsible for the missing drives was met with cold stares from committee members of both parties members of the senate have awaited the secretary s appearance for several days after he last week declined an opportunity to offer senate testimony saying he wanted to wait until he had more information sen strom thurmond the safety of weapons secrets has dogged richardson for much of his tenure as energy secretary during his watch los alamos scientist wen ho lee was removed from his position amid charges of spying he has been formally charged with mishandling classified information not espionage and awaits trial members of congress have also raised red flags over the reported sale of computers once used at the savannah river nuclear weapons facility in augusta georgia those computers two senators intimated wednesday may have once contained classified information that could have been reconstructed by their new owners sen strom thurmond r south carolina suggested at wednesday s hearings that some of the savannah river computers may have been sold to the people s republic of china sen john warner in his opening statement armed services chairman john warner r virginia lined richardson himself up for accountability saying that although richardson has worked to change the security culture at the energy department and the national laboratories ultimately responsibility for ongoing lapses rests with him mr secretary warner said directly to richardson on june rd of last year you told this committee in this room the secretary of energy and i quote you must be accountable and must be responsible for such security failures we are holding you accountable warner said these incidents happened on your watch like the captain of a ship you must bear full accountability appearing at the hearing sen richard shelby r alabama chairman of the senate select committee on intelligence repeated his earlier calls for richardson s resignation saying i think it s time for you to go harsher still was the criticism leveled by sen robert byrd d west virginia a member of richardson s own party who said richardson s pledges to get to the bottom of the case would not sway the opinion of the senate whose trust he had lost permanently sen richard shelby the horse is out of the barn byrd said referring to richardson s refusal to testify last week byrd said you ve waited and shown contempt of congress that borders on supreme arrogance speaking directly to richardson a one time congressman and former ambassador to the united nations byrd said you had a bright and brilliant career but you will never again receive the support of the u s senate for any office you seek you have squandered your treasure richardson who at times looked stunned by the tone taken by many committee members sought to defend himself arguing that he wanted to have all the facts in hand before making a congressional appearance he added that he had made vast changes in the security culture at the department and in the nation s weapons laboratories and had put off a good many longtime employees as a consequence i ve been excoriated but if you go into the scientific and academic community i am driving scientists away he also said he has been accused of racism in the wen ho lee case and has had to battle members of own party who saw regular polygraph tests for employees as a violation of civil rights sen james inhofe r oklahoma suggested that the captain of the ship wasn t richardson but president bill clinton who inhofe said was responsible for a variety of security policy changes and leaks to the media that have led to a relaxed careless attitude among those charged with overseeing the nation s weapons secrets serious loss of control over classified information also appearing before the panel was dr john browne director of the los alamos facility dr john browne browne while attempting to illustrate for panel members with charts just how difficult it is to gain access to the x division admitted that his security operatives have lost control over how classified information is handled mainly because there is no set procedure to determine who handled much of the material and when this is not an environment one can easily get into he said still browne said there is a serious loss of control over classified information at my laboratory adding perhaps for the benefit of committee members that he had no knowledge that the information has been compromised or tampered with from a national security perspective these are positive indications richardson was congratulated by sen pete domenici r new mexico for ceding all weapons security issues to a newly confirmed director of a semi autonomous agency formed to assess and reformulate all security procedures sen pete domenici air force gen john gordon confirmed by the senate to helm the agency but not as yet sworn into the post will report to richardson but will not be directed by anyone else at the energy department the senate had held up gordon s confirmation for months for unspecified reasons but he was unanimously confirmed last week after news of the hard drives disappearance was released the best thing you could do to leave a legacy for america in terms of nuclear weapons is to get this agency operational domenici said scolding richardson not to engage in any dual hatting and let gordon make the changes he needs to make warner was less congratulatory warning richardson outright that he must honor the law creating the agency and allow it to go about its business unfettered the panel closed its session to the public and members of the media just after noon on wednesday so specifics of the case could be discussed domenici predicted earlier in the day that a closed session would yield much more in the way of disturbing information we could go into a closed session and you wouldn t believe the things you d hear in there he said these things have to be corrected too when proceedings ended at mid afternoon richardson told reporters he just wanted to do his job and conclude the investigation he said the fallout from the security breach was too political adding i did not utter one partisan word in that committee conflicting statements initially air force gen eugene habiger the energy department s top security officer and los alamos lab director john browne said in congressional testimony that a scientist had reported seeing the two devices in the vault on april a month before they were found missing and seven weeks before senior lab officials were notified gen eugene habiger but sources familiar with the investigation told cnn on tuesday that this account has come under suspicion because of conflicting statements made during interviews and polygraph tests another individual has told investigators he went into the vault on april and would have noticed if they had been missing then but does not recall actually seeing them what s clear said goss is that there was inadequate tracking on paper of the use of the two drives which belonged to an emergency nuclear response team members of the team known as nest have been the focus of the fbi criminal investigation the team is trained to be ready to find and disarm a nuclear device on short notice the disks or drives are designed for use in a laptop computer and are part of an emergency response kit available to team members all individuals who had unescorted access to the vault have been given polygraph tests according to richardson browne the lab s director has testified that security rules for the tracking of items classified as secret were eased government wide in to reduce the cost of handling the large amount of documents carrying this designation in early it was extended by then president bush to government contractors such as the university of california which runs the los alamos lab the policy was continued by the clinton administration the president s foreign intelligence advisory board a year ago cited inadequate tracking of secret nuclear materials in a stinging rebuke of security at the energy department and its weapons labs while the current los alamos security break likely did not involve espionage in some ways it s worse former sen warren rudman chairman of the advisory board said in an interview espionage is very hard to guard against you win some and lose some here you ve got a situation where there is just sloppy accountability and record keeping the associated press contributed to this report

i agree with rick i know jose is tied up on current business but his input will be important to date we have been relying on legal analysis of required approvals etc that information is essential but it is as you know about of the issue the far more critical considerations are how is the government likely to react on a political level and what can we do about it i think our government affairs people are in the best position to make these assessments forwarded by steven j kean hou ees on am richard shapiro am to diomedes christodoulou enron development enron development cc steven j kean hou ees ees subject project california i have reviewed the most recent im and don t have any significant comments but my review did highlight the need to have a set or sets of eyes internally who understand the regulatory overlay of the southern cone better and who are also in a better position physically and with language skills to assess the nature of the regulatory approvals needed and to effectively pull on a set of local resources when this project begins to take shape with all of that in mind i would recommend we at the very least bring jose into the loop i intend to stay actively engaged and do whatever i can but we need help immediately on the regulatory front the last thing i would want to have happen to the project would be have it held hostage at the governmental approval stage being proactive now by bringing jose over the wall would be my strong recommendation please advise,0

inc all rights reserved dutch gas competition grows despite sluggish reforms by germana canzi of dow jones newswires  dow jones energy service copyright c dow jones company inc london dow jones the netherlands is emerging as an important testing ground for e u gas liberalization as new trading hubs for competitive short term gas supplies from the u k and norway emerge on the belgian and german borders however much remains to be done a group of large energy users and traders is preparing to confront gasunie thursday in a hearing organized by the regulator the main issues of contention are the balancing system which gasunie conducts on an hourly basis the extent to which transport tariffs are cost focused and third party access to storage facilities the emergence of competition in the dutch gas sector is mostly due to the initiative of new market entrants who despite a difficult regulatory environment have managed to develop a market for short term gas virtually from scratch if liquidity improves in these emerging hubs the netherlands could become an important transit country for freely tradeable gas supplies to other countries in northwest europe as well as being an important market in its own right however the difficulty of implementing transparent third party access systems in the netherlands and in neighboring germany casts a dark cloud over recent progress in competition since december enron europe ltd u ene duke energy corp duk e on ag eon rwe ag g rwe and electrabel sa b ele have been actively buying and selling gas sourced in the u k the netherlands and norway in a number of hubs between emden in germany and emshaven and oude statenzijl in the netherlands david gallagher head of european gas trading at enron in london estimates that at least one trade a day of around therms for a quarterly contract is done at the oude statenzijl hub where the gasunie pipeline system connects to the network of wingas gmbh an important element kick starting short term trading was the sale in december of a billion cubic meter a year norwegian gas supply contract to five dutch based power generators robert van der hoeven head of fuel procurement at electrabel the owner of dutch generator epon said his company uses most of the gas it imports from norway for its plants in the netherlands and trades the rest on a short term basis in the oude emden area this pattern is common to the other dutch based parties to that contract trading in dutch hubs received a further boost when nederlandse gasunie nv n neg decided after months of wrangling with regulator dte to lower its transport tariffs by from january and to unbundle its combined commodity and service tariff the so called css system from july gasunie now claims its pipeline system is fully open and transparent to prove this it says it has lost of its customers in the eligible market but that figure hasn t changed much since march small wonder that critics say the switching figure doesn t necessarily indicate an ideal system of third party access according to energy consultants the brattle group around half of the gas used by alternative suppliers goes through the bcm year zebra pipeline from zelzate to zeeland which was built by dutch utilities a few years ago precisely because gasunie refused to provide access on favorable terms shippers have complained that the hourly system used by gasunie to balance the pipeline system raises the overall cost of shipping through its network significantly gasunie imposes a balancing charge which effectively forces shippers to pay for the extra gas brought into the system from storage sites in addition to the capacity and transmission price critics say gasunie has so far failed to unbundle these charges although it agreed to do so in january according to the brattle group another controversial aspect of gasunie s tariff system is that it is based on theoretical costs of constructing new pipelines rather than its actual costs the dte is also considering ways of reforming the storage system to make it competitive bp plc u bp and nederlandse aardolie maatschappij nv operate storage facilities and lease capacity to gasunie through long term contracts the regulator is studying ways of allowing third parties access to storage facilities gasunie has so far shown little sign of negotiating more competitive tariffs with storage operators and passing on the benefits to customers critics say the growth of short term trading in the dutch gas market is also inevitably linked to its potential as a transit country for gas coming from the u k belgium gas interconnector and going towards the bcm a year german market market participants say liquidity at the emden and oude hubs has grown considerably since e on and rwe started trading there earlier this year however the obstructive attitude of incumbents toward third party access there has meant that so far most gas traded in the netherlands has

said tuesday the utility s tentative billion agreement to sell its power lines to the state could take until to be consummated thanks to complicated legal issues and other paperwork an edison official told bondholders tuesday once the deal is signed edison will try to borrow against the promised cash but edison international chief financial officer ted craver admitted the utility might have to ask creditors to simply wait for their money until it has the billion in hand energy suppliers owed money by edison did not immediately return calls for comment tuesday at least four groups of suppliers have sued edison for millions in unpaid bills going back months edison and fellow utility pacific gas electric have said they have lost billion on the open power market thanks to soaring prices paired with state imposed price caps pg e s parent company was able to recently borrow billion to pay its stockholders and its debuts it did not use any of that money to pay pg e s bills edison s disclosure meanwhile shocked state officials steve maviglio spokesman for gov gray davis initially declined to comment on the status of the edison deal but eventually said regarding its closure we re optimistic it will be sooner rather than later the pacing would have nothing to do with whether fellow utilities sempra energy and pg e also sell their transmission lines to california craver said among the things that could delay the deal s closing is edison s need to find landowners on whose property its lines were built to assure no legal agreements are being violated by the sale edison would also have to pin down exactly what it would be selling to the state terms that might not be decided until after a deal has been inked craver said trust me craver said in a phone call after the conference there are a lot of legal type documents stuff that you and i would think of as a bloody nightmare the disclosure comes at a time when an increasing number of power suppliers are suing the utility for millions in unpaid bills edison also disclosed tuesday that two more lawsuits had landed in its lap one by a group of wind powered generators including enron wind the other by two suppliers including new york based caithness energy both suits were filed during the past five days edison assistant general counsel barbara reeves said it was not immediately clear how much the complainants were seeking neither enron nor caithness returned calls for comment the two filings bring the total number of suits by renewable energy suppliers against edison to four the utility said the city of long beach and calenergy operating group a geothermal supplier have also sued for back payments calenergy alone has said it is owed million in november and december payments the line sale part of a multifaceted tentative deal with the state that could save edison from insolvency could take anywhere from several months into next year craver said the tentative deal announced by gov gray davis feb calls for the state to pay more than twice the book value for edison s lines it also would require edison to sell cheap power to the state for a decade and for edison to end its lawsuit against state regulators the suit asserts that price caps imposed by the california public utilities commission are illegal under federal law additionally edison s parent would have to return million it collected from the utility

find adequate according to the report the public utilities commission can halt the rate hike and order refunds if it decides the hike isn t necessary the puc is holding hearings to determine the prudency of the hike and members of the state s powerful casino and mining industries have filed to intervene sierra pacific s plan to shore up its financial position through the sale of its power

term contract with the state that expires in about two weeks the company will only sign a long term contract once it s paid more than million owed by pacific gas and socal ed spokesman richard wheatley said mirant said it also won t sign contracts with the state until it s paid enron said it s reached agreement on terms with the state but has some credit related details to hammer out everything s been agreed to except for some credit technicalities enron spokesman mark palmer said meanwhile small independent power plants in california that are capable of generating megawatts of power are shut down because their owners haven t been paid by the state s two main utilities the california independent system operator said tuesday the decline in small plant output has contributed to the state s power supply problems the past two months partnerships involving el paso corp epg for example shut down megawatts of generation last weekend due to nonpayment the company said tuesday socal ed hasn t paid the owners of the smaller generators known as qualifying facilities since early december which means the generators are still owed for electric production in october while pg e has paid only a small percentage of its qualifying facility bills since its last full payment in early january the plants one third of which are powered by renewable sources like wind and solar power meet almost of california s electricity needs almost all of the closed generators are fueled by natural gas and many haven t been able to pay their gas suppliers and have been cut off from their gas supply the california senate energy committee plans to vote on legislation to create a new pricing system for all qualifying facilities this week the proposed bill would cut the prices to qualifying facilities from about cents a kilowatt hour the past eight months to about eight cents depending on the price of five year natural gas contracts the generators can sign the plants that run on

see my initial email to sam schott and stephanie about rd email from the bottom there s two samples of how we could set divisions the same could be said for dba s forwarded by tana jones hou ect on pm mark taylor pm to bill d hare hou ect ect cc samuel schott hou ect ect tana jones hou ect ect stephanie sever hou ect ect subject urgent counterparty divisions cargill ferrous international bill if sam s description below of the gcp procedure is correct it looks to me like something needs to be changed the difficulty lies in the fact that the confirmation system reads the counterparty s name from global counterparty since divisions of companies are not legal entities they do not have the power to contract in their own names if the correct legal name is not in global counterparty the confirmation goes out with the wrong legal name on it seriously compromising the contract itself that is the source of tana s concern regarding the correct entering of divisions in the system my suggestion is that global counterparty use the same name that the customer has signed on the enrononline password application my understanding is that the enrononline team returns inappropriate applications to the customer until they are correctly completed in this particular case since the counterparty is still not allowed to transact on enrononline almost a month after sending in their application they are understandably upset and are now complaining i would appreciate it if you could get this one fixed today and if you have any problem with changing the gcp procedure please let me

barrow hr corp enron enron michelle cash hou ect ect david o dell hr corp enron enron mary joyce hr corp enron enron david oxley hou ect ect subject re payroll company for incoming foreign nationals for the employees to be provided with domestic benefits they could just be placed on the standard domestic payroll whereas the employees not to have domestic benefits could be on the new company as cynthia states below the new company as a whole would not be adopting benefit plans logistically there would just need to be different procedures for setting up the new hires on the correct company also the administration of the cross charges will be much easier once sap payroll comes online currently there is some manual intervention when charging from one company like expat services to the appropriate accounting company mike from jane allen ect am to cynthia barrow hr corp enron enron michelle cash hou ect ect cc david o dell hr corp enron enron cynthia barrow hr corp enron enron mary joyce hr corp enron enron david oxley hou ect ect michael b jones hr corp enron enron subject re payroll company for incoming foreign nationals good point we would want to pick and choose as some may not want to remain on home country payroll or a home country payroll may not exist michelle can you comment from a legal perspective thanks jane cynthia barrow enron am to jane allen hou ect ect cc david o dell hr corp enron enron cynthia barrow hr corp enron enron mary joyce hr corp enron enron david oxley hou ect ect subject re payroll company for incoming foreign nationals the not making them eligible for domestic benefits is easy the new payroll company will simply not adopt the plans i am assuming that the number of employees nor associated demographics in this company will not create a discrimination problem one question though will we treat all foreign nationals the same or will you want to pick and choose who receive domestic benefits and who does not if the answer is yes to this we will probably need to run some legal traps let me know if we can help cb from jane allen ect am to michael b jones hr corp enron enron cc david o dell hr corp enron enron cynthia barrow hr corp enron enron mary joyce hr corp enron enron david oxley hou ect ect subject payroll company for incoming foreign nationals as enron expands globally we are faced with a growing issue of more and more foreign nationals entering the us on varied lengths of assignment for some it is necessary that they remain on their home country payroll to maintain retirement benefits as our domestic benefits structure k cash balance etc does not provide them with equivalent benefits based on the fact they will return to their home country to retire if they remain on their home country payroll system we are struggling with a convenient method to have them pay us taxes both income and possibly social security as well as receive us currently david oxley is on such an arrangement he is paid by the uk a portion of his pay to maintain uk benefits the remainder of his salary is paid on us payroll this allows him to pay in fit withholding no fica medicare is necessary due to the totalization agreement with the uk unfortunately this created some extra work on the domestic benefits group as they had to code the hr system not to provide him with flex dollars health welfare and retirement benefits we indicated in his employment agreement that he was not eligible for these benefits i am looking for an easier and more efficient way to do this would it be possible to create a payroll company here in the us for arriving foreign nationals that remain on their home country payroll that would allow them a mechanism to receive a portion of their pay in us into a us account pay in fit and possibly fica medicare not make them eligible for domestic benefits i would appreciate you and the others i have copied looking into this thanks jane,0

clfp proposes the following changes to medium and large commercial and industrial customer tariffs for electric service provided by pacific gas and electric company and southern california edison company clfp proposes the commission establish an optional summer on peak peak period consisting of a continuous hour period during the current summer on peak period for both utilities the hour period would be selected by the customer specifically service eligibility customers served as medium or large commercial industrial customers on time of use rates and metered accordingly examples pg e s e e etc and sce s tou etc customer eligibility electric customers processing handling distributing or processing perishable food and agriculture products as noted below since no revenue shift occurs within the class the commission may consider opening the option to others customer charge surcharge a surcharge of per meter per month for the initial summer period to offset the utilities cost for changes to billing procedures in the case of optimal billing period service customers the surcharge shall correspond with such billing period optional summer on peak period any continuous hour period during the summer on peak period of time hours may be designated by the customer consistent with metering capabilities of the customer or changes to metering capability the reason for designation by the food processor or agriculture commodity processing customer is in order to take into account the many factors involved in load shedding labor harvesting schedules and coordination with growers delivery schedules inspection activity etc all bear upon such an effort rate for optional summer on peak period service energy rates for the hour period would be two times the otherwise applicable charge for summer on peak energy the other hours of the hour on peak period would be billed at the non peak rate and equalized for rate revenue neutrality in the event partial peak periods are retained the rate for the non optioned hour period during the on peak period would be adjusted to retain revenue neutrality these rates would apply as now workdays of monday friday notice and service an eligible customer must notify the utility in writing by fax email or hand delivered to both the appropriate account representative and the customer billing department of the request for optional summer on peak period service the hour period of optional service and the start date for such service shall be specified start dates should coincide with billing cycles with a minimum of seven days notice prior to such cycle optional optimal billing period customers would be treated accordingly except as currently provided a two day advance notice implementation issues tou meters and billing it appears the number of customer meters and billing changes potentially required by optional summer on peak period service is relatively small compared to the total number of meters of the utilities in response to clfp s data request by pg e and sce attached the following is observed for sce sic food and kindred products customers account for approximately meters out of about meters of the all but can be managed locally by the customer data acquisition system the would appear to require a field visit for pg e out of tou meters on e and e service or of the total are sic of the nearly half are hourly interval meters the remaining presumably would need a field visit for reprogramming conclusion based upon the data supplied metering and billing changes required by an optional summer on peak period program for processors of perishable commodities there does not seem in clfp s opinion to be a significant barrier to establishing the program,0

attached is the form of schedule to the isda master agreement we use for purely financial transactions swaps and options there are a large number of choices and variables to consider in these documents and usually whenever an enron company begins financial trading in a new jurisdiction we work with local counsel to adapt the form and then handle most of the drafting and negotiating from here to the extent you are interested in using isda master agreements we will be happy to continue in the same way i m not sure they will be much help in constructing the type of physical commodity agreements i suspect you need if you need the printed form of the isda master that the schedule relates to let me know and i can have it faxed to you when the transaction is physical even if there is an embedded swap or option of some kind we use physical commodity contracts which vary widely from commodity to commodity i will ask elizabeth sager to send you some sample electricity forms and jeff hodge or dan hyvl to send some natural gas forms in a trading context since enron may be on either side of one or more transactions with the same counterparty the forms are drafted in a bilateral fashion basically we only ask for thing we are willing to give if your situation is different e g our transactions with one party involve only the purchase of fuel and with another party only selling electricity dramatic changes to these forms might be in order with regard to loan finance transactions i am not at all familiar with forms they use and in fact those transactions may be individualized to the extent that they don t even use forms as such i will ask julia murray to contact you or have one of the people in her group get in touch with you to talk about those types of transactions unfortunately i don t know of an electronic table of contents to the forms there is a project underway to create a forms database but it is in the very early stages of thought enron capital trade resources corp from andrea bertone andrea bertone ei enron com pm to mark ect legal taylor hou ect bhendry ei enron com cc robert h george robert h george ei enron com subject ect forms when we met in buenos aires a couple of months ago you mentioned that you might be able to provide robert george and i with some ect forms that would help us with our deals in the southern cone of course these forms would be used as a guideline and would be adapted as needed to comply with local laws we would be interested in any electronic copies of any ect forms where i enron is a party to either side of a physical or financial swap fuel and or electric ii enron is a party to fuel or electricity supply agreements interruptible or firm iii enron is a party to loan finance documents and iv enron is a party to construction o m agreements equally useful might be an electronic table of contents to the ect form books that brent mentioned having when i was last in ba thanks much,0

stinson do we want to revisit vince forwarded by vince j kaminski hou ect on pm martin jermakyan martin electrapartners com on am please respond to martin jermakyan martin electrapartners com to vince j kaminski hou ect ect cc subject my resume dear vince attached please find an updated resume of mine i have been continuing my research in the area of pricing risk management and asset management of power industry it seems to me that the framework i have been working on does allow addressing some fundamental issues and allows describing the salient features of power markets i feel a brief info may inform you what have i been up to conceptually speaking my approach relies on the understudying that the absence of cash and carry implies non hedgibility of the most fundamental building blocks of power market forward contracts of hourly duration this clearly demands a risk premium embedded in power prices i have been able to develop a machinery to capture this risk premium and calculate its impact on pricing of other products in particular the method allows consistent generation of hourly forward curve per each geographic region hence generation of forward curves of longer duration it provides us not only with forward curves but also their physical not risk neutral distribution it also allows one to analyze the sensitivity of the forward curve with respect to the volumetric risk as a fundamental input i consider the ratio of properly compounded generation output load and the corresponding maximum available generation supply the first one is well observable and forecastable due to its stationarity the second one is defined by the first one and the generation and transmission profile of the region much of the required information is in the public domain the market price of risk incorporated in the model depends on this ratio and the calendar time this time dependence of the market price of risk allows capturing of the dynamics of the returns per unit risk over time and its dependence on the ratio mentioned above reflects the intuition and the reality that closer the demand to the maximum available supply higher compensation do the investors expect i have also realized that the transmission related factors may be incorporated into this framework in a very consistent and robust manner this approach also allows quantification of the margins as a stochastic process dependent on the volumetric factors among other things it allows posing and solving the problem of maximization of the margins while keeping their variance under control in a very elegant and robust way i have developed the first version of mathematical tools and prototype software reflecting all these issues my inability to complete this program has been resulted from the severe instability lack of access and the cash flow problems i have experienced in the last few years i have also understood that programs of this magnitude cannot be finished from the grandpa s garage nevertheless i think i have developed a very systematic and robust understanding and methodology and at least i have convinced myself that this approach leads to a comprehensive system with all this said i don t want to make an impression of a stiff person who has his agenda and under any circumstances is willing to push it forward i have always been very flexible and in my consulting experience i have always accommodated the needs and wishes on my clients in my short period of employment with altra i have been very ethical i have played by the rules i have done whatever i have been asked to do and have been a team player the reasons they have asked me to resign have nothing to do with me personally they have been respectful to me they have valued me as capable person but have found that given the direction of the company which has become self evident with the consequent developments further altra goes further i will be frustrated with where they go it was almost formulated that it is better for me to separate from altra as soon as i can as an evidence of appreciation they have continued paying me as of today something that they have not done for some others but it is coming to its end too i am bringing this up just to reiterate that my separation from altra has had nothing to do with me or my entrepreneurial working style vs corporate style etc i have no doubts that i can function equally well in either environment i wish that your presentation goes well with your new superior and that my joining enron becomes a possibility regards martin martin doc,0

reliant and williams will all send executives to sacramento to the meeting  gastrader net bulls cautious in spite of slip sliding natural gas prices analysts are still cautiously bullish there seems to be little incentive to abandon the bullish cause with the prospects of hot summer weather looming this is a weak market but i think that below you have to anticipate the return of industrial demand it s really a wild card as to whether that demand will take the edge off the current large injections over the past month the market has gone through a major change production has increased storage is higher and the injection last week at bcf was the largest since june of says george ellis broker analyst with bnp paribas new york i was skeptical of the whole concept of demand erosion but it s obviously real and when you combine that with an increase in production the supply demand balance becomes clear there is potentially more room to the downside but the wild card is weather and if that kicks in prices could move sharply higher if prices fell to then that would be a reason to put on another hedge as long as we re holding these prices i think there s a good chance prices will rally

given the numbers we got from mark baldwin is this where we are the overall economics of the pipeline project have to be supported almost entirely by the new power plant at most we could assume maybe day of gas load from industrials near the airport and another x from kirtland s gas load this assumed load will ramp up over several years or longer depending on how long these folks existing contracts are and not be available immediately we know the bogey for pricing the electric contract for doe its probably kwh less to make it attractive or maybe less either way a low rate we now know the best case scenario for cost on the pipeline about mm in the configuration without the isleta lateral or the lateral over to the power plant maybe about mm total we don t have absolutely reliable info on electric transmission constraints from the proposed plant to palo verde so i d suggest that for now we just assume that we would be unconstrained on power sales at palo verde are there alternative liquid markets available that might have better pricing ercot pub serv colorado i m not entirely sure how you guys are looking at the overall economics but to my non business guy mind the following scenarios or something similar stick out as the key benchmarks that will decide whether the project makes sense a worst case assume we build a mw power plant i e assume no extra power to sell in spot market and assume we get the kirtland gas load but no additional gas load from the customers baldwin talked to if the rate for the gas line is the minimum rate that enron could live with based on our internal hurdle rates can we hit the doe target power price and have any left over i suspect this scenario is upside down should we look at two alternative configurations for the power plant combined cycle and simple cycle b mid case assume we size the power plant at mw or some similar size based on a turbine configuration that makes sense and that we sell the surplus power at palo verde prices less albequerque palo verde transmission costs again assume no incremental gas load except kirtland if the gas pipeline rate is set at the minimum rate enron can live with does the power plant make enough to make the project work c wildly optimistic case same as mid case except add baldwin s gas load and start ramping in some estimated amount of additional gas load when nm gas restructuring kicks in in did i get the year right also start ramping in some estimated amount of high priced retail power sales to back out the palo verde spot sales at whatever year nm retail electric restructuring is expected to kick in also i think with optimistic assumptions like this does it make sense tino suggested a meeting to talk economics in detail around the first of may ideally we ll have a feel for the above relationships and the transmission constraint situation by then thanks df,0

authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the limit dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it receives but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably interfere with the production from the existing non compressed gas entering the system please submit your written application to joe thompson at the dominion gathering production office the application must indicate the amount of incremental gas for the specific compression agreement dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing time frames we will balance that consideration with our need to insure that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other producers therefore once granted the applicant must have the compression in place and operable within six months of dominion s approval or the rights to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited in the event that more requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for which there is capacity dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis please include in your written

an emergency federal directive two other suppliers agreed they would continue sales as well u s district judge frank damrell citing the possibility of obvious irreparable harm to the public said tuesday his temporary order requires reliant energy services inc to continue sales at least until a further hearing on wednesday wholesalers aes pacific inc and dynegy power corp not covered under the temporary injunction said they would continue sales until that hearing as well the suppliers provide enough electricity to serve million homes electricity grid officials said losing that source could

kdougherty collectamerica com sent wednesday october pm subject fw debate second presidential debate transcript  jim lehrer welcome to the second presidential debate between vice president al gore and gov george w bush the candidates have agreed on these rules i will ask a question the candidate will ignore the question and deliver rehearsed remarks designed to appeal to undecided women voters the opponent will then have one minute to respond by trying to frighten senior citizens into voting for him when a speaker s time has expired i will whimper softly while he continues to spew incomprehensible statistics for three more minutes  let s start with the vice president mr gore can you give us the name of a downtrodden citizen and then tell us his or her story in a way that strains the bounds of common sense gore as i was saying to tipper last night after we tenderly made love the way we have so often during the years of our rock solid marriage the downtrodden have a clear choice in this election my opponent wants to cut taxes for the richest percent of americans i on the other hand want to put the richest percent in an iron clad lockbox so they can t hurt old people like roberta frampinhamper who is here tonight mrs frampinhamper has been selling her internal organs one by one to pay for gas so that she can travel to these debates and personify problems for me also herpoodle has arthritis  lehrer gov bush your rebuttal  bush governors are on the front lines every day hugging people crying with them relieving suffering anywhere a photo opportunity exists i want to empower those crying people to make their own decisions unlike my opponent whose mother is not barbara bush  lehrer let s turn to foreign affairs gov bush if slobodan milosevic were to launch a bid to return to power in yugoslavia would you be able to pronounce his name  bush the current administration had eight years to deal with that guy and didn t get it done if i m elected the first thing i would do about that guy is have dick cheney confer with our allies and then dick would present me several options for dealing with that guy and then dick would tell me which one to choose you know as governor of texas i have to make tough foreign policy decisions every day about how we re going to deal with new mexico  lehrer mr gore your rebuttal  gore foreign policy is something i ve always been keenly interested in i served my country in vietnam i had an uncle who was a victim of poison gas in world war i i myself lost a leg in the franco prussian war and when that war was over i came home and tenderly made love to tipper in a way that any undecided woman voter would find romantic if i m entrusted with the office of president i pledge to deal knowledgeably with any threat foreign or domestic by putting it in an iron clad lockbox because the american people deserve a president who can comfort them with simple metaphors  lehrer vice president gore how would you reform the social security system  gore it s a vital issue jim that s why joe lieberman and i have proposed changing the laws of mathematics to allow us to give to every senior citizen without having it cost the federal treasury a single penny until the year in addition my budget commits trillion over the next  years to guarantee that all senior citizens can have drugs delivered free to their homes every monday by a federal employee who will also help them with the child proof cap  lehrer gov bush  bush that s fuzzy math i know because as governor of texas i have to do math every day i have to add up the numbers and decide whether i m going to fill potholes out on rt east of abilene or commit funds to reroof the sheep barn at the texas state fairgrounds  lehrer it s time for closing statements  gore i m my own man i may not be the most exciting politician but i will fight for the working families of america in addition to turning the white house into a lusty pit of marital love for tipper and me bush it s time to put aside the partisanship of the past by electing no onebut republicans  lehrer good night,0

i m adding my two cents here s but not few things i considered that everything was material that reasonable dylan i struggled with the ban on preservatives but ultimately decided it was unusual not extraordinary since the book sez that any write down of inventory is unusual as opposed to extra but a case for extra can still be made i think i did not include the litigation expense associated with the ban since it seems to me that it s merely an expense that they would have taken in as opposed to a potential litigation outcome that they d make an allowance for i could be wrong though finally i assumed that the depreciation related gain was already included in the income from continuing operations number and consequently included it as a footnote on my spreadsheet rather than make it an explicit line item in the income statement i ll look at kim s and if i have any comments i ll add them to hers and circulate best jeff kimberly kupiecki kkupiecki arpartners com pm to dwindham uclink berkeley edu cc jjackson haas berkeley edu jdasovic enron com jcjcal aol com christine piesco oracle com subject agro q questions litigation how should we account for the bill of in i assume this was not accounted for in the income statement we could include a note on pro forma numbers for the statement or we could just include this cost in i am including it in the recalculated income statement but i don t think this is totally accurate thoughts anyone in the text page other gains or losses from the sale or abandonment of pp e used in a business is not supposed to be reported under extraordinary items this means the two sites agro sold for after tax gain should not be counted under extraordinary items in this case we could assume this is accounted for already in the million number given to us or add it in after income from continuing operations and before discontinued operations i went with option let me know if you have any issues with this treatment are we supposed to do anything with the of retained earnings i did not include pay out of dividends in the income statement cheers agro doc agro xls kimberly kupiecki director a r partners kkupiecki arpartners com main direct fax,0

enron development enron development jane wilson enron gateway wade cline enron development enron development stephen wallace corp enron enron subject egep eogil customs duty inquiry on offshore production we were served summons by the customs office in surat asking for meetings with our platform managers and on dec th we sent two representatives operations mgr legal to answer their questions over a two day period they inquired about production and logistical issues and asked a number of questions regarding product delivery points pricing formulas etc in summary they are trying to build a case that the gas and maybe even the crude we sell in india is subject to a customs duty since it is produced outside of the mile territorial limit they are trying to make the case that we are importing the gas and oil into india obviously this is not the case and there is no merit for such consideration but we don t want to let this idea get entered as a show cause filing against enron and our partners there would be remedies such as court or arbitration but the timing to resolve this is probably years furthermore this issue would most likely impact current efforts we have on going therefore we are taking the issue very seriously and plan to meet in mumbai next thursday to chart an appropriate course of action once we meet we will get back to cliff and jim derrick regarding our recommendation on thursday morning december st houston time cliff and jim if you are planning to be out of the office please drop me an e mail where you can be reached meeting in mumbai next thursday will be chris walker of linklaters local indian counsel saberwal myself mike stewart dominic carolan egep legal and certain representatives from eogil we would also like to have jane wilson eipl gov t regulatory affairs for india present if she is available jane it is not mandatory that you are present but if you can t attend could you send me an e mail where i could reach you if necessary the meeting will be at eogil s office and fatima samuel will confirm the time and place once chris walker s schedule is known it is my understanding that chris walker will be in india on tuesday and wednesday working with wade s group on other matters this issue came up originally in right after we started producing gas at tapti at that time we had legal opinions prepared and the legal team tells me the positions were very strong in our favor on a variety of fronts after a few meetings and a couple of letters the issue went away and never resurfaced again until now we suspect that this issue has been an open item since that time and for a variety of reasons ongoing activities someone feels it needs to be checked off the list hence the revived interest at this time the reason we are giving this such a high level of attention is probably obvious but the reason we want to act upon our plan immediately once we get together next thursday may seem less necessary however today our office received more summons for different people to report to surat next tuesday wednesday and thursday this time they have asked for our production manager logistics manager and lead accountant we have requested an extension due to the short notice and holiday season and expect to have it granted but we will not know if it is postponed before monday if we have to go we will have legal counsel attend with the individuals named this level of back to back activity for a government office at this time year is a concern going into the meeting with the legal guys on thursday we are thinking that we need to have a highly respected person such as saberwal deliver our message to multiple groups i e surat customs ministry of finance mopng as to the lack of validity for this potential claim and what we would do if they proceed by thursday i think we will have all of the necessary color on this issue and with the team mentioned above we will be able to develop the right plan of action however due to the level of interest and activity of the surat customs group we anticipate that our recommendation will be to move quickly hence my desire to contact cliff and jim next thursday for approval to proceed i have included wade and rebecca eipl as well as steve and john pr for information purposes at this time this first stage plan we will be seeking approval for next thursday will be to meet with certain people in an attempt to keep this from becoming an issue this should be a fairly quiet issue for indian standards next week and even the subsequent meetings that i m anticipating would take place in the following two weeks ought to be very low keyed items however in india you never know and considering some of the existing press of recent we should get prepared and make sure we are co ordinated john following our thursday decision we should probably talk about our plan so if you ll leave me a note where you can be reached i d appreciate it in summary the odds are we will be able to manage this and it won t become a big issue however we need to take this very seriously and deal with it proactively and quickly before someone files something without understanding the consequences of the action i am leaving for india on sunday and when possible i will pick up my mail i will also be checking voicemail if you need to leave a message i will be the mumbai office on tuesday thursday and friday and in delhi on wednesday jeff,0

instrumental in helping to set it you are absolutely correct it is great to do market research if time permits or it is regarding an issue of which we have little knowledge as  you are aware over the past year we have engaged a professional recruiting  firm brecker merryman who has assisted us in a number of different mark et research projects however in my opinion this issue is not one that required much research i have been involved in recruiting in some way shape or form at both the graduate and undergraduate level for the past  years most major organizations with the exception of the accounting firm s begin the summer intern recruiting process in early spring there are actually some universities that do not allow recruitment of summer interns  until after a certain date particularly in the mba programs for example  harvard does not allow an organization to come on campus and speak to first  year students until january as indicated the firms that generally recrui t in the fall are the accounting firms and they are primarily recruiting for  spring internships the recruiting strategy at enron is no different this year than it was last  year with respect to summer interns presentations were made in january  february and offers were made in february and march the only school that  did not follow the normal process was ou under the direction of george hope  we did of course recruit summer interns in the fall for the tax group because they are competing directly with the accounting firms utilizing this strategy did not impair enron s ability to hire quality s ummer interns this past summer enron had summer analysts undergraduate and  summer associates graduate we intentionally limited the number of summer hires to ensure that the individuals hired received meaningful assignments approximately of these individuals received permanent offers to join enron the reason enron has not had a problem recruiting quality undergraduate summer interns is primarily because many organizations do not hire undergraduates for summer positions they generally focus on mbas particularly the investment banks and consulting firms which are the firms  that jeff skilling identifies as enron s competitors because the undergraduates are not actively recruited by our competition we have continued to have a special focus on these individuals i e the reason the re were undergraduates and only mbas with respect to ou and ut specifically since those were the schools about  which you raised a concern let me address your concerns in your e mail y ou indicated that you had research conducted at ut and ou you did not howeve r provide the results of the research or the person to whom they had spoken  therefore i had lexi elliott contact both ut and ou while ou has not gotten back to her following is the information obtained  from ut o the contact at ut career services is cindy henson o according to cindy approximately of companies actively recruiting on  campus conduct interviews in the fall for summer internships cindy attributes this to the fact that these companies cannot come in the spring  or in the case of andersen consulting have a tremendous need and conduct  all interviews at one time o in conclusion cindy estimated that of companies actively recruiting on campus recruit in the spring for summer internships we have not received information from ou therefore i am unable to provide t he statistics at this time i will provide as soon as i am in receipt of such  information it appears that the information your source obtained is considerably different than what we were told if you would provide the name of the individual to whom they spoke i will follow up to determine the reason for  the discrepancies while i understand your concern with respect to ou they appear to be different than most of the other schools at which we recruit if you belie ve that it is critical to recruit summer interns at ou in the fall we are supportive however because lexi has other school interviews that are already scheduled she will not be in a position to facilitate the interview  process during the trip you have scheduled currently as you are aware in  most instances the dates for presentations and interviews are dictated by  the respective universities and were secured in early august if you would  like for her to try and secure an interview schedule for a later date this  fall she can certainly work with your schedule and her current schedule to  support your efforts i hope this has been helpful i can understand and appreciate your frustration if you are not getting answers from the recruiter or her manager again i offer that i am available and willing to work with you i f you are having difficulty with members of the program staff please let me know what you decide about recruiting this fall for summer interns and whether i can be of any additional assistance charlene,0

electricity equipment out of the cleveland forest and a wilderness area by thomas buckley the press enterprise lake elsinore a new group has raised its objections to lake elsinore s proposed hydroelectric plant and the power lines that might carry its electricity to san diego county on thursday the elsinore valley municipal water district board set aside for further study later this month a motion by director gary kelley to ensure that both the lines and the actual power plant that make up a million proposal from enron north america proceed together but residents of la cresta a mountaintop community near where the lines might run did not care whether the plant and lines happened together many of them do not want the lines to be there at all we are resolved to keep power lines out of the cleveland national forest and the san mateo wilderness area said la cresta resident bill stockmar our constituents and the local residents impacted by the proposed project are outraged and respectfully demand immediate intervention to stop this project at the planning level as it stands now the power lines from the hydroelectric plant would run from temescal canyon to camp pendleton along the ridge line of the elsinore mountains just west of the lake those lines could run in a narrow strip of forest land just west of the la cresta community enron project manager rob bakondy said the final determination of where the lines might run is not set but he said the power lines could be built at least a year before the plant itself besides serving the hydroelectric plant the power lines could be used to replace lines san diego gas and electric wants to build through murrieta and temecula to bring power to san diego the water district also announced it is considering financing and building the lines itself district general manager john rossi said wednesday that it was too early to say exactly how the lines would be built but that the district s building or owning the lines or both in cooperation with enron is one possibility board president kris anderson said it is too early to tell whether it would benefit the district to become so directly involved in the project but he said the district would be able to borrow the approximately million needed to build the lines at a lower interest rate than a private company could get that difference anderson said could mean extra dollars for the district how governor davis proposal to purchase thousands of miles of transmission lines from the ailing utilities will affect the project is not yet clear said enron spokeswoman kathy russeth the timing of the construction of the project if it is approved by state and federal regulators will not be finally known until a contract between enron and the water district has been agreed upon that is expected to happen by the end of may    gop in a fix over power crisis leaders seek solutions that won t undercut past support for deregulation by daniel borenstein times political editor california republican party leaders are trying desperately to politicize the state s electricity crisis by blaming gray davis but it seems that the harder they try the more popular the democratic governor becomes the latest gop push will come today when party leaders meeting in sacramento for the start of their three day state convention hold a hastily organized workshop on energy we should be explaining to california that gray davis was asleep at the switch last year said one of the scheduled speakers republican strategist dan schnur but that message can only work if it s coupled with a proposal for an alternative solution so far that hasn t happened for all the complaints about davis republicans are moving even slower looking to when davis will stand for re election the gop has run radio ads attacking the governor for delays but the party has yet to distinguish itself with a solid plan of its own if republicans are able in the next couple of months to articulate a clear plan which is different from the democratic plan yes we can use it as a political message said stuart deveaux spokesman for the california republican party are republicans in sacramento going to come up with a plan that articulates a future for our energy problem i m not telling you it s going to be revealed this weekend it s my hope it will be articulated this weekend republicans are caught in an ideological quagmire pushing for re regulation of electricity conflicts with the party s basic tenet of less government interference conversely arguing for full deregulation puts republicans at odds with a solid majority of californians a los angeles times poll taken feb found that percent of californians want to go back to a regulated electricity industry while percent are opposed the gop problem is exacerbated because there is no easy policy solution to the energy mess said jack pitney government professor at claremont mckenna college it s difficult to see how we get out of this situation without considerable cost if there were a silver bullet somebody would have found it by now republicans have attacked davis for his plan to buy power lines from private utilities everybody agrees there s billion or billion in deferred maintenance said gop consultant sal russo another speaker at the party s convention today we need to be in this business like a hole in the head but the times poll found that californians by a margin favor the idea moreover davis job approval rating has climbed this year in january percent approved and percent disapproved in february it was up to californians give davis better marks for handling the electricity crisis than they give president bush republicans are going to have difficult time laying the political blame on davis it s murder on the orient express everybody did it pitney said although you can make a case that davis was slow in reacting no one can seriously pin him with the primary blame for the problem the deregulation bill passed the legislature in with the strong support of both parties and a republican governor pete wilson senate minority leader jim brulte r rancho cucamonga is considered one of the republican party s top strategists he was also one of the leading proponents of the deregulation bill for all of those reasons garry south davis political strategist said he does not fear a gop attack on electricity if the republicans want to get into a full out firefight over how this mess came about i m more than willing to play they don t have a very good story to tell for now davis political strength is stable but the primary elections are still more than a year away and the general election is a political eternity from now if this isn t resolved there is nothing to guarantee that there won t be a voter backlash against the government said political analyst sherry bebitch jeffe and right now the government in california is the democratic party that s the message the republicans want to drive home but if they can t come up with their own alternative they might have a hard time playing the blame game    davis says state has tentative deal for edison grid updated feb p m los angeles after a week of intense closed door negotiations with utility representatives gov gray davis said friday he had reached an agreement in principle with southern california edison to buy the utility s power lines for an estimated billion the deal also requires edison international the parent company of edison to sell cheap power to the state for a decade this is the framework of a good balanced deal davis said it s not a final deal there s a lot of work to be done but we re making progress the governor said he did not expect customer rates to increase as a result of the deal edison did not immediately return calls seeking comment the state has been in talks for a week to buy a total of miles of transmission lines from edison pacific gas and electric and sempra energy which operates san diego gas electric the total cost of the lines could range from billion to billion the effort is intended to help restore the financial health of the state s two largest utilities pg e and edison both of which are near bankruptcy the billion price for the edison lines amounts to times the estimated book value davis said the utilities say they have lost nearly billion since june trapped between soaring wholesale power prices and state imposed rate caps for consumers the tentative plan announced by davis would allow edison to issue bonds for a substantial portion of its losses davis said the state is making good progress in its talks with sempra and some progress with pg e thursday davis said he will not sign off on any grid buyout without all three utilities participation i do not believe we can make a satisfactory arrangement without percent of the transmission grid and that would require cooperation with pg e he said friday pg e spokesman ron low said thursday night that talks had ended with no resolution that day these are complicated problems that will not be solved overnight low said there are clearly some issues where we are very far apart still pg e chief executive officer robert glynn jr said friday the meeting with davis was a milestone in the resolution of california s energy crisis and said he was willing to meet further to discuss the utility s proposal each utility s issues and opportunities in this crisis are different and we believe that pg e has proposed a detailed solution that balances ratepayer and shareholder interests glynn said in a statement issued friday before the governor s news conference the company said it would have no further comment the tentative agreement also calls for edison parent edison international to make payments to the utility of about million edison international to commit the entire output of its sunrise mission power project at low cost based rates for years davis said that arrangement could save ratepayers million over the next two years edison to provide cost based rates from generating plants it owns for another years edison to drop its lawsuit against the california public utilities commission claiming that imposed rate caps were illegal under federal law this entire transaction which i believe is fair and balanced for both sides will be accomplished within the existing rate structure davis said we will not be asking any more of consumers to allow this transaction to come to pass davis said negotiations will continue in the coming days consumer advocate harvey rosenfield called the governor s plan an outrageous giveaway and predicted that if lawmakers didn t halt it voters would revolt the most outrageous part of this isn t even paying times what the lines are worth but then allowing the parent companies that siphoned off billions of dollars to pay only the tax payment they already owe rosenfield said the public utilities commission already regulates how much the utilities can charge for power their own plants generate rosenfield said by leslie gornstein associated press writer    utilities search for long term fix during breather state purchase of power lines under discussion friday february san francisco chronicle sacramento a break in the weather and a break in the energy crisis coincided yesterday as california enjoyed its first day in more than a month without a power alert with the short term picture for power improving representatives of the state s three troubled utilities met separately with gov gray davis and his staff to work on a longer range fix for the power crisis that would include state purchase of the firms transmission lines trouble loomed in at least one set of talks however as pacific gas and electric co said it was very far from reaching a deal the california independent system operator which coordinates the flow of electricity through the state s power grid removed all power alerts at about a m yesterday spokeswoman lorie o donley said that with springtime approaching and weather improving and with some power plants coming back to full output from maintenance the overall picture is brightening we re optimistic she said we re coming into the spring season the majority of generators have had their maintenance completed but everything is dependent on the weather and temperature the last day california had no power alerts was jan since then there have been two days of rolling blackouts in northern california and many other days of stage alerts when power reserves dip below percent of available capacity the mildest alert stage is declared when reserves are between and percent of capacity the supply of power has been helped by warmer temperatures in other western states cutting demand there and by an increase in generators on line in california o donley said last week when the state was still in stage alerts megawatts were offline in california yesterday there were megawatts offline a difference that provides enough power for a couple million homes o donley warned that the supply picture in california is still tight and conservation still necessary but the focus of attention was turning to sacramento and davis talks with the utilities davis announced a plan last week for the state to purchase miles of utility owned transmission lines in exchange for backing bonds that allow the utilities to repay the almost billion in debt they say they owe while southern california edison and san diego gas and electric have indicated willingness to sell their lines pg e has refused to comment on the proposal it is not clear if pg e is unwilling to sell or simply trying to strike a harder bargain the utility had accumulated more debt than its southern california counterparts and also owns the largest part of the transmission line grid talks between davis staff and pg e did not start until late yesterday afternoon and indications were that they were more difficult than negotiations involving the other two utilities they re just on a different page michael peevey the former edison president who is davis chief negotiator told bloomberg news pg e spokesman ron low said these are difficult problems that cannot be solved overnight there are clearly some areas where we are very far apart davis hopes to make an announcement with at least one of the utilities before leaving today for the four day national governors association meeting in washington d c the union that represents some pg e employees meanwhile called on davis to negotiate state ownership of two power plants under construction in which pg e holds large stakes jack mcnally business manager of the international brotherhood of electrical workers local in walnut creek told davis in a letter that a transmission line takeover would be a grand experiment fraught with danger acquiring the two prospective power plants in kern and san diego counties would do more to address energy shortages than taking over transmission lines that need hundreds of millions of dollars in maintenance union officials said davis spokesman steve maviglio countered that state acquisition of transmission lines would not affect one union job as the state would simply lease the grid back to the utilities maviglio predicted union jobs would increase with investment in new capacity and system upgrades chronicle staff writers patrick hoge and robert salladay contributed to this report   state s energy price tag increases published friday feb in the san jose mercury news by dion nissenbaum mercury news sacramento bureau sacramento california s energy crisis took another big bite out of the state budget thursday when finance aides to gov gray davis announced that the cost of buying energy may top billion by mid march in a move that raised new alarms for lawmakers the governor s finance team for the third time this month asked for million to buy electricity in the coming weeks while davis tries to work out a deal to bail out the state s near bankrupt utilities that combined with money spent last month to buy energy could drain the state coffers of billion by st patrick s day the request for more cash came on the same day that california spent its first day in weeks without an official energy emergency and davis held critical talks with the heads of pacific gas electric co and san diego gas electric co the talks are aimed at rescuing the two companies and southern california edison from financial collapse while davis had expressed hope last week of working out a deal by today sources said that an agreement still remains elusive until a compromise can be hammered out the state is being forced to pay upward of million a day from the general fund to buy electricity state leaders expect that the money will eventually be repaid to the general fund under a billion bond package but lawmakers are growing increasingly concerned about the short term impact on the state fiscal plan assemblywoman carole migden d san francisco said the latest request for more money could create greater concern and anxiety among lawmakers and added that the energy crisis was going to make it harder to fund other programs such as support for abused children it s going to be a bleak year for other budget priorities said migden who is chairwoman of the powerful assembly appropriations committee earlier this week the state s independent financial analyst warned that the energy crisis could eat into state money the governor wants to spend on other things such as the environment and public safety while lawmakers have so far bitten their tongues about the growing power price tag migden said the legislature might be hesitant to allow the costs to go any higher i can t imagine another infusion after this being required migden said i think this has to be the last request because we re going to hit fundamental core programs waiting for bailout plan california stepped in to buy the energy last month after pg e and southern california edison lost the financial wherewithal to do it themselves at the time state leaders reluctantly agreed to buy the energy for a short period of time as part of a larger plan for california to sign long term contracts with power generators but those negotiations have failed to produce much energy so far and davis said earlier this week that the power producers are hesitant to sign any deals until california agrees to a bailout plan for the utilities on thursday one power producer williams cos announced that it had signed a year contract with the state to provide up to megawatts of power to california in a bid to work out the bailout plan davis and his advisers met thursday and were to meet again today with top executives from all three electric utilities in financial trouble the democratic governor wants to buy miles of high voltage transmission lines owned by the three companies in exchange for helping the utilities pay off billion in debts the utilities are being asked to protect thousands of acres of wilderness lands they own hang onto power plants that provide the state with its cheapest electricity and drop explosive lawsuits that could allow the companies to dramatically raise customer rates but sources said talks have bogged down on the transmission line deal which pg e has been reluctant to accept alternative energy helps out while talks slogged along in the governor s office state lawmakers announced that another key piece of the puzzle needed to solve the energy crisis was falling into place state sen jim battin r palm desert and assemblyman fred keeley d santa cruz said that alternative energy producers had agreed to dramatically lower their prices in a deal that could save california billion to billion those energy producers nearly wind solar and natural gas fired plants provide about a third of the state s energy   paying for power still a big question power crisis pg e doesn t like the plan the puc proposed to collect electricity costs by mike taugher times staff writer three weeks after gov gray davis signed into law the state s centerpiece for stabilizing energy costs big differences remain over how the solutions will be implemented and who will pay for them the plan outlined in legislation known as ab x was intended first to stop the financial bleeding of california s two largest utilities by asking the state to buy enough unsecured power to keep the lights on next the state would enter long term contracts for less expensive power that would eventually lessen the need for more costly last minute electricity but the state has balked at buying the entire portfolio of last minute electricity that is needed and a disagreement emerged thursday over what portion of consumers bills should be used to reimburse state coffers meanwhile progress on completing contracts has been slow although two were signed thursday a spokesman for davis said more contracts for relatively low cost power would be signed once the state bought the utilities transmission lines and other assets because then the utilities could pay their past due bills the governor said last week that he expected a deal with the utilities by today but that might not happen clearly there s been challenges getting long term contracts but we ve turned the corner said davis spokesman steve maviglio we ve got three in the bank and more once we get these deals with the utilities done also thursday the public utilities commission was poised to allow the state to collect the entire amount that customers pay specifically for electricity but pacific gas electric co said it is entitled to deduct other costs from customers payments before reimbursing the state that would reduce payments from pg e to the state by about half according to the company the puc proposal was in response to a request from the state department of water resources that it be allowed to start collecting money so that energy companies would be more willing to sell power to the agency the two republican appointed commissioners of the puc blocked the move which needed four of five commissioners approval to reach the agenda dwr s action is exacerbating a problem ab x was meant to alleviate said commissioner richard bilas it is pushing the utilities closer to bankruptcy pg e spokesman john nelson said the proposal brought by puc president loretta lynch would have been unfair to the utilities because ab x allows them to deduct expenses for buying electricity and generating energy at their own power plants before reimbursing the state all of those costs need to be paid going forward otherwise you still leave the utilities to bleed nelson said that stance appeared to be at odds with the office of assemblyman fred keeley the boulder creek democrat who wrote ab x for pg e to think it can keep money for electrons it never even owned is astounding to us said guy phillips a keeley aide while nothing has gone smoothly phillips and others expressed optimism that the state s biggest effort to date to fix the energy crisis would work we think those will be sorted out said phillips who acknowledged there has been much confusion about what lawmakers intended in ab x for example keeley s office said lawmakers wanted the water resources agency to make up the entire amount of electricity that the state s two largest utilities had not secured ahead of time the high cost of this last minute electricity and the utilities heavy reliance on it is what drove pg e and southern california edison to the brink of bankruptcy but the water agency has balked at buying electricity offered at prices it calls unreasonable while state officials have refused to say how much electricity it has left to utilities to purchase the state is paying about million a day to keep electricity flowing and that amounts to about percent of the electricity purchased on behalf of the utilities on the same day it is needed according to phillips the state s reluctance to buy all of the so called real time electricity has led to fears that the utilities will continue to run up debt and that power companies will not collect money owed to them that dispute has landed in federal court where a sacramento judge is forcing three major power suppliers and a marketing company to continue selling power in the state if a settlement is not reached today u s district judge frank c damrell is expected to decide whether to extend his order to modify it or to drop it staff writer andrew lamar contributed to this story   lowenthal returns utility money by will shuck from our sacramento bureau sacramento assemblyman alan lowenthal d long beach this week joined a small group of legislators who returned campaign contributions to california utility companies and other energy firms he sent back to southern california edison and to sempra energy parent company of southern california gas it was a small portion of the more than lowenthal lowenthal had raised in for his re election campaign he said he returned the money as did nine other assembly members at the urging of the consumer advocacy group global exchange we think it s fantastic that he has recognized that in the eyes of the public there is a very serious potential conflict of interest said group spokeswoman medea benjamin we applaud him for wanting to ensure the integrity of the legislative process while benjamin says it s critical that lawmakers not be tainted by energy money during the state s power crisis others wonder where the line should be drawn in the real world of politics it costs money to run for office and you have to get that money somewhere said paul schmidt a political science professor at cal state long beach to say that you can only make decisions on things involving individuals that haven t given you any money would result in paralysis of government benjamin and other consumer advocates say the power crisis calls for special consideration there are not many cases in which they re actually voting whether a company will survive with billions of dollars of taxpayer money or go bankrupt as they re doing with the utility companies benjamin said lowenthal agreed i thought it was an appropriate request he said these are unique circumstances and i just think it s in the public s best interest that i return that money   dan walters a power grab by politicians published feb slowly but inexorably control over the generation acquisition and distribution of electric power in california is being shifted from professional utility managers and independent regulators into the hands of politicians the utility deregulation scheme enacted by the legislature was an initial foray into politicization legislation granting the governor more control over the makeup of the public utilities commission was another but the current power supply price crisis has led to even more direct political influence over or interference with electric service one hastily enacted bill for example gives the governor direct control of the now misnamed independent system operator which operates the statewide power grid more political intrusion is in the works from a state takeover of the intercity power transmission grid to the creation of a state power authority that would buy generate and sell electricity directly and while local public utilities function well a state power agency might operate on the whims of professional politicians the legislature for example wants appointments to the board that would direct a state power authority and big state power projects would be subject to the same kind of pork barrel mentality that distorts other public works appropriations where power plants were to be built or where high voltage lines would be strung might well depend on who could and could not bring political influence to bear rather than what the system needed to work efficiently clues to the potential pitfalls of a state operated power system are found in the approaches of capitol politicians to the current crisis there is for example the unspoken goal of avoiding big power rate boosts until after the november election even if it means running up billions of dollars in debts to do it would future rates charged by a state power authority be raised or lowered to enhance the prospects of the dominant party or an incumbent governor there s no evidence in past performances to indicate they wouldn t be and then there s the knotty question of who would get vital power supplies in the event of shortages a situation that is already looming and could become worse in future months emergency legislation already gives the state the right to sell power as it pleases without competitive bidding or even public notice there s nothing really to prevent politically influential power customers such as big industrial enterprises from cutting their own supply deals with politically directed state officials and whose juice would be cut off if shortages mean blackouts approximately percent of current power customers are effectively exempt from rolling blackouts because they are connected to circuits called blocks that also include vital services such as hospitals fire and police agencies water supply systems and communications centers the capitol not surprisingly is in one of those noninterruptible blocks with the threat of further blackouts looming legislation is being drafted to designate which customers will suffer and which will not thus taking that authority out of the hands of utilities and regulators and that in turn is generating pressure from lobbyists from all sorts of interest groups to place their clients on protected lists should farmers be cut off or biotechnology facilities or computer chip plants or schools when politicians control any process or system one can be certain that they will always make expedient political decisions regardless of the long term or wider consequences thus we may someday regret allowing the capitol s self serving politicians to get their hands on our electric power system   discount urged near power plants senator urges electricity rate break for neighbors of generators friday february san francisco chronicle as california officials propose building new peaker power plants across the state by july one legislator from plant rich eastern contra costa county thinks residents should get a discount on their power bill for having a generator in their backyard the proposed bill would provide a little payback for residents of state sen tom torlakson s district which is home to a half dozen plants and has three more in the construction pipeline under the bill introduced yesterday by torlakson d antioch people living within a mile circle around a power plant would receive a percent discount on their electricity bill and be exempt from blackouts the legislation was partially inspired by san jose officials rejecting a proposal to build a megawatt power plant in the coyote valley as well as gov gray davis plan to build megawatts of new generating capacity by july it s a question of fairness torlakson said people in communities who are shouldering the burden for having plants in their backyard should get some benefit from it torlakson said consumers who lived in communities without plants could pick up the tab for the discounts but the utilities would have to figure that out within their rate system he said a pg e spokesman said yesterday that the company does not comment on pending legislation while consumer advocates environmentalists and power generators were lukewarm to the proposal yesterday many admit that the state has not thought about how to of even if they have to offer communities a little incentive to approve a power plant within their borders however the state has allocated million for plants that get online by july as far as incentives i d think most communities would see the value of the employment they d get and the increase to the tax base said larry hamlin the governor s recently appointed project manager for the plant building campaign a spokesman for california s environmental protection agency which permits plants said the plan might be a worthwhile idea for making power plants more palatable to californians michael shames head of utility consumer action network in san diego said the bill was attacking a not in my back yard problem that doesn t exist many san diego communities are clamoring for plants in the hope that they would bring stability to the market he said james peters of mirent the atlanta based company formerly known as southern energy said the plan wouldn t encourage generators to build the number of plants needed to solve the energy crisis already communities like pittsburg have cut deals with power generators before letting them build in exchange for letting the calpine corp build two large plants in town pittsburg received the lifetime option to purchase megawatts of power at below market rates next week a pittsburg group is going to begin gathering signatures demanding that city leaders use the estimated megawatts it would take to light residences and businesses to give local residents a break on bills the group will hold an organizational meeting at p m tuesday at the los medanos community hospital loveridge rd in pittsburg   at last power alerts are lifted enjoy respite because crisis far from resolved experts say by carrie peyton bee staff writer published feb as oddly as it arrived california s electric emergency lifted thursday morning at a m the independent system operator which controls most of california s grid ended a stage alert it was the first time since jan that the state hadn t been under a power emergency declared when low supplies threaten grid stability the alerts included straight days of stage emergencies the black clouds that gather before rotating outages the clouds cleared on a day when predicted peak use was low but not the lowest it has been for the last five weeks many power plants were back on line after repairs but more plants had been operating during at least one stage day so what happened a little luck a little planning and maybe a little group psychology said those who have closely watched recent gyrations of the state s electric roller coaster it is a roll of the dice said gary ackerman head of the western power trading forum which represents plant owners and marketers if it continues for the next three or four weeks i wouldn t be too surprised that ll be our respite enjoy it the end of a day string of emergencies could mean a few more lights in store aisles or a little less worry about running an electric furnace some speculated it might also mean lower wholesale prices but major changes are not likely in the steady rain of conservation calls that have fallen on californians since the north state was twice plunged into rotating blackouts last month i hope people don t just go back to wasteful ways said mike florio of the utility reform network a consumer group now that the emergencies have dissipated we don t have to talk about imposing hardships on people but prudent use of energy is an idea we re going to have to live with for a long time he said at the iso longer days and slightly warmer weather was credited with decreasing peak demand for electricity supplies are up within the state and power imports from the pacific northwest have risen significantly said jim detmers who manages grid operations plus in one of the biggest changes the state department of water resources has begun getting more power supplies lined up at least a day in advance he said since the department stepped in to buy power on behalf of cash strapped utilities it has often managed to line up about percent to percent of what the state needed to supplement utility controlled supplies according to detmers that meant grid operators had to scramble to buy the rest on very short notice but starting last friday the state began to schedule about percent of its purchases at least one day in advance the operators are able to enter a day with a lot more confidence about being able to make it detmers said you don t have to search to find those megawatts at the last minute closely in sync with increased purchases by the state the iso dropped from a stage emergency to stage on friday and then slid to a stage wednesday the stages are based on how much reserve power is left for unexpected crises a stage is declared when reserves slip below percent for their part power buyers at the water resources department weren t sure what has made the difference over the past few days it s certainly not that people are lining up to sell us power at cheap prices said jim spence the department s director of emergency operations we re just buying whatever we can and it turned out that it was easier to make ends meet he said he couldn t make any prediction about how long that would last the string of power emergencies has been unpredictable from the start erupting in winter when california s hunger for electricity traditionally declines and supplies are usually so flush that plants close for tune ups consumer advocates and power traders blamed finances for the emergencies rather than a fundamental lack of supply as fears of utility bankruptcies triggered a descent into market chaos and high stakes political maneuvering but basic supply shortages are expected to move to the forefront by summer when temperatures rise and demand soars meanwhile the brief respite whatever the reason brought palpable relief to those charged with keeping the power grid stable when we found out yesterday during the board meeting that we were only in stage we broke out in applause said florio who sits on the five member iso board the change also could be good news for consumers who may one day be paying higher rates for the wholesale electricity now being purchased by the state getting out of a stage typically means prices are going to ease florio said when you re even in a stage that s a signal to everybody they re short that means we can hold them up now   davis deadlines on energy much easier set than met by emily bazar bee staff writer published feb exactly one week ago gov gray davis sounded hopeful optimistic even when he predicted that the state and its debt ridden utilities would forge an agreement by today on a plan to save the companies from financial doom problem is it won t work out that way negotiations between state officials and the investor owned utilities have produced no comprehensive agreement to announce today davis predictions during the energy crisis have been wrong before for weeks he has set deadlines for agreements and legislative action that haven t been met on deadline days even when there s little substantive progress to report davis often holds news conferences anyway many of them on friday afternoons after financial markets close the democratic governor s office scheduled an announcement for today in los angeles even though one utility representative said agreement is far away davis actions have fueled speculation that he s trying to force consensus by setting artificial deadlines and putting a spin on the news and tarnishing the state s credibility in the process i can t see how you would negotiate such a complex deal like the purchase of the transmission grid in such a short period of time it doesn t seem realistic said gary ackerman of the western power trading forum an association of wholesale generators i guess the people i represent have turned it off they have stopped listening they hear it and say ok sure here s another photo op last friday davis told a gathering of reporters that state officials and the utilities would agree by today on a rescue plan for the utilities i believe we ll have agreement before next week is out on exactly what should go in a piece of legislation he said at the time and hopefully that legislation will be passed by the end of the following week legislative veterans said his comments were ill advised and unrealistic davis met into the night thursday with top officials of pacific gas and electric co but no agrement was reached these are complicated problems that will not be solved overnight said pg e spokesman ron low on some issues we are very far away from agreement sources said pg e has been unwilling to negotiate sale of its transmission lines which davis has said is a necessary component of a deal more progress was reported with the two other near bankrupt companies san diego gas and electric co and southern california edison although sources said talks with them were far from concluded davis has been setting specific deadlines for himself and the legislature for months in november the governor promised to present a comprehensive plan by dec to stave off a full blown energy crisis but ended up offering only a modest slate of proposals davis called feb a drop dead date by which he hoped to cement a deal between lawmakers and the utilities there s no deal yet davis told reporters that he and the state s legislative leaders would reach a consensus agreement on the proposal to take to utilities by last friday it didn t happen he made the announcement alone leon panetta a white house chief of staff under former president clinton said it s important that the governor set deadlines because the nature of politics is to delay however he cautioned against missing deadlines you have to be careful that you keep the deadlines you establish because the more that you establish and not meet the more that begins to lose its value as a political tool panetta said the governor can t continue to indefinitely set deadlines without facing consequences cautioned steven fetter managing director of the global power group at fitch a credit rating agency based in new york at some point he warned creditors and power suppliers may push the utilities into involuntary bankruptcy which would trigger an official deadline that can t be ignored the dispute would be tied up in court at a judge s discretion eventually there is going to be a real deadline fetter said the problem is it s probably not a deadline that will be set by gov davis it s a deadline that will be set by the banks and the electricity suppliers in several cases when deadlines haven t been met davis has held a news conference regardless unveiling little new information and scant detail on jan for instance the governor promoted the broad framework of a plan to save the utilities rather than a detailed plan that had been anticipated one prong of the plan aggressively promote energy efficiency conservation and demand reduction among consumers businesses and public entities davis spokesman steve maviglio said that the governor continues to set deadlines because it s important to show that the state is making progress particularly to wall street he added that it s not the governor s fault the deadlines have been missed many of the dates have been blown away by factors no one has been able to foresee or have control over court decisions actions by creditors weather you name it maviglio said the governor sets deadlines that continue to move the ball forward and he has been successful at doing that many of these announcements came after p m on fridays triggering suggestions that the governor has attempted to spin the facts and manipulate the markets timing announcements after the close of east coast financial markets is commonly used by politicians who don t want to send stocks soaring or tumbling by making an announcement panetta said you want people to evaluate what s happening so there isn t a panic reaction to a news flash going over the wire he said but market analysts say that ever since pg e and edison stocks plummeted in early january the governor s statements haven t significantly affected their performance there has been so much news that has been so negative for the companies that i don t think it makes much of a difference said ed schuller a senior vice president for the full service brokerage firm sutro co it s beyond that point now   gop sees power crisis as davis achilles heel republicans line up to run for governor friday february san francisco chronicle democratic gov gray davis politically wounded by the state s power woes has become the target of a growing pack of republicans looking to turn him out of office four months ago davis looked on track to get re elected by a voice vote said dan schnur a gop strategist but the energy crisis has exposed vulnerabilities that have encouraged others to look at the governor s race the governor s backers however are confident california voters will recognize davis is dealing with a problem that has been brewing for years through previous republican administrations if the republicans want to have a full out firefight over who brought this energy crisis down we re ready for it said garry south the governor s top political adviser it s a fight they can t win with the primary election still more than a year away no one but davis is a sure bet to leap into the contest but at least three names will be circulating when california republicans meet in sacramento this weekend for their state convention secretary of state bill jones los angeles investor bill simon jr and actor arnold schwarzenegger all have made noises about challenging davis but so far their incipient campaigns have been more talk than action simon s effort might be the farthest along but he also has the longest way to travel a political unknown the year old simon runs his family s investment company and has been active in a number of charitable organizations in southern california simon whose father was treasury secretary under president richard nixon has brought in veteran gop consultant sal russo to study a possible run for governor bill simon feels we need a governor who s prepared to lead and not one who s focused on fund raising or the next political office russo said in a jab at davis simon was an assistant u s attorney in new york but founded william e simon sons with his brother and late father in the billion private investment firm owns a number of companies and has also invested heavily in south of market real estate in san francisco wealthy political outsiders don t have an enviable record in recent california elections republican michael huffington spent million to lose a senate race to dianne feinstein darrell issa dropped around million in a losing race for the gop senate nomination al checchi spent about million of his own money to lose the democratic primary to davis in  while simon likely would be spending plenty of his own money on a governor s bid he s working to get outside support both political and financial before committing to the race russo said with the state s problems mounting and the economy increasingly shaky the time may be ripe for a political unknown he added when things start going bad people are willing to look outside for a new face someone who will get things done russo said jones is anything but a political outsider a veteran legislator from the fresno area he is now serving his second and last term as california s secretary of state he managed to hang onto his job during the gop s electoral debacle which cost the party every other constitutional office while jones has long talked about a run for governor he s still playing coy we have not made any decision and probably won t make one until early march said rob lapsley one of jones top advisers right now we re putting together information for bill to make a decision while jones role as the state s top gop officeholder makes him an obvious choice to challenge davis he s made a number of political enemies over the years many of them in his own party his surprise decision last year to switch his support from george w bush to arizona sen john mccain in california s presidential primary won him no fans among bush supporters and could hurt his attempts to raise money for a gubernatorial bid money is a major problem for jones who listed in his campaign fund last month compared with nearly million for davis some of his opponents have suggested that fund raising woes may force jones to run for an office other than governor right now we re focused on the governor s race lapsley insisted the real republican wild card is schwarzenegger the movie action hero who would be instantly recognized by nearly every california voter while schwarzenegger s publicist told the chronicle last month that he had no plans to get involved in next year s governor s race the austrian born star was on the telephone to a los angeles times columnist days later talking about his love for politics and his political ambitions fame however has its drawbacks as the year old schwarzenegger has found an article in premiere magazine entitled arnold the barbarian accused him of groping women on movie sets and generally boorish behavior while the supermarket tabloids have him on the cover this week suggesting that his marriage to maria shriver is on the rocks south davis political adviser gleefully sent copies of the premiere article to reporters across the state suggesting that the piece lays out a real touching story if you get what i mean whoever ends up with the gop nomination still will face an uphill battle against davis a popular governor and a take no prisoners campaigner i ve been predicting since day one that the gop would find some moneybags candidate to throw against gray south said that s why we ve kept our political and fund raising operation going since election day   pressure is on utilities to accept grid sale energy gov davis wants accord today but edison executive says company might prefer bankruptcy by dan morain and nancy vogel times staff writers sacramento his credibility at risk and california s energy future on the line gov gray davis on thursday turned up the heat on the state s utilities to accept today a series of tentative rescue accords that would put the companies transmission systems into public hands how far the utilities are willing to bend to the governor s intensified pressure was unclear late thursday given davis mandate a top executive of southern california edison said his company is now being forced to seriously contemplate whether it might fare better in bankruptcy court we are weighing two very unpalatable alternatives he said two alternatives facing the utilities are either to sell their electrical transmission systems to the state at a price they consider too low or gamble in bankruptcy court that they could hang onto their valuable assets after nearly a week of negotiations davis administration officials said they hoped to announce today a partial deal that would calm the utilities jittery creditors and help subdue california s runaway electricity market state officials said thursday they were close to agreements with edison and san diego gas electric but remained at odds with the state s biggest utility pacific gas electric which has balked at giving up its transmission grid these are complex issues that cannot be resolved overnight said pg e spokesman ron lowe there are clearly some areas where we are very far apart on thursday edison chairman john bryson conferred with members of his utility s board of directors but by evening the company s top executives still had not decided whether to acknowledge that an agreement is near although the utility has begun to contemplate the protections of bankruptcy it is unclear when or if such a dramatic action would occur davis is believed to be offering roughly billion for the utilities transmission grids the companies could use the cash to restructure their debt which resulted from the utilities inability to pass along their soaring wholesale electricity costs to ratepayers davis has significant political and fiscal reasons for wanting to make an announcement today he is scheduled to arrive in washington for the national governor s assn conference this weekend meet with u s energy secretary spencer abraham on sunday and attend the democratic governors assn annual fund raising dinner monday night davis a prodigious fund raiser is chairman of the democratic governors assn and the dinner is expected to raise more than million of that amount davis political organization raised in excess of million said garry south his chief political advisor any progress davis can cite could help improve his national political standing but his aides say it s especially important to be able to show at least a semblance of an agreement when he travels to new york on wednesday to confer with wall street analysts on thursday those analysts reacted exuberantly to early hints from the governor s office that settlements with the utilities might be announced the recently anemic stocks of edison international and pg e corp soared on the new york stock exchange on a day when most utility stocks closed lower edison jumped per share or to close at while pg e gained or to per share that suggests that someone thinks something good is happening in sacramento said analyst james d von riesemann of morgan stanley dean witter co but some analysts fear investor enthusiasm might be hasty i m concerned that the governor s optimism may not coincide with all the parties at the table and it may not coincide with the legislature said paul patterson utility analyst at credit suisse first boston corp davis met thursday with steve baum chairman of sempra the parent company of sdg e administration officials are confident that an agreement can be reached but the san diego company is the smallest of the state s three major private utilities and its debt is far smaller million compared to the combined billion that edison and pg e say they have amassed baum is willing to listen said sempra spokesman doug kline we re on the record as stating that we are willing to consider the sale of those transmission assets if it helps solve the crisis pg e executives had been scheduled to start meeting with davis at a m thursday but in what was seen a slight against pg e davis aides did not summon negotiators for the northern california utility including company chairman robert glynn until after although the parties continued to wrangle over details there was progress thursday on the sidelines state officials announced they had signed a long term contract for a relatively small amount of electricity with a major energy supplier an achievement that was perhaps more symbolic than substantive tulsa based williams cos said it had agreed to a year deal to sell power to the department of water resources by april the company will provide at least megawatts enough electricity to supply homes at times of the day when demand for electricity soars such peak supplies will increase through next summer and reach megawatts by according to williams the agreement is only the second such long term contract since davis signed a bill feb putting the department of water resources into the power buying business for many years to come at least other power suppliers have reached understandings with the state davis said wednesday but those companies refuse to sign deals the governor said until the state finds a way to help california s two biggest utilities pay off their billion dollar debts as soon as we revitalize the utilities the governor said i think you ll see a lot of movement on long term contracts another small but important piece of the state s energy plan emerged thursday when legislation was introduced by sen jim battin r la quinta to slash the rates paid to alternative energy producers a move expected to shave billion or more in annual costs charged to the big private utilities reducing the amount paid to producers of renewable energy such as solar wind and biomass power is considered a crucial step in keeping expected consumer rate hikes down and after days of dangerously low electricity supplies the state got a reprieve thursday morning when grid officials lifted the state s electrical emergency status for the first time since jan so far the state has spent nearly billion buying electricity on behalf of the utilities according to the department of finance which informed the legislature on thursday that it will release another million for electricity purchases  times staff writers nancy rivera brooks nancy cleeland and mitchell landsberg in los angeles and julie tamaki and jenifer warren in sacramento contributed to this story   energy firms won t pay all of monster debt puc reverses taxpayers could foot the bill christian berthelsen chronicle staff writer friday february under a ruling yesterday by state regulators california taxpayers could be on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars in power purchases the state has made in behalf of two troubled utilities the california public utilities commission voted unanimously to absolve pacific gas and electric co and southern california edison of responsibility for any costs above the revenue they collect from ratepayers the ruling reversed a position taken earlier by the commission which had said the utilities were responsible for making up the difference between the state s costs and their own revenue john tremaine a pg e spokesman said the funding needed to make up the difference could come in the form of a surcharge imposed on customers who use percent of the baseline amount of electricity that is one option under a bill passed last month by the legislature he said but steve maviglio a spokesman for gov gray davis said the governor does not believe the money will come from ratepayers electric bills the costs maviglio said could be covered by the billion bond measure the state recently issued to cover power purchases as california tries to resolve its power crisis state officials are working out the precise way that should be done under the state s deregulation plan approved in the utilities have been forced to absorb skyrocketing wholesale electricity costs while being prevented by law from passing the increases on to customers through higher rates since the california department of water resources began buying power last month details showing how it will be repaid how much or by whom have not been established yesterday s puc decision was an attempt to begin setting the repayment criteria a precise accounting of how much money is at stake is impossible to determine at this point officials said because pg e declines to release ratepayer revenue figures and the state is refusing to say exactly how much it has spent buying power officials estimate the state will spend billion by the beginning of march and davis authorized the expenditure of million more yesterday the state s department of water resources became the buyer of record on jan when the two utilities credit was so damaged that they were no longer able to buy power both utilities had opposed the commission s previous position that they be responsible for all power costs the puc s shift yesterday was summed up by commissioner richard bilas who said he could not support holding the utilities responsible for the revenue shortfall the dwr is not about to go bankrupt the utilities are he said yet consumer advocates downplayed the commission s ruling yesterday nettie hoge executive director of the utility reform network said the ruling only dealt with the narrow issue of who has to account for the revenue shortfall and did not reach an overarching decision about who ultimately will be financially responsible for it this is not a huge deal she said the state has been buying the lion s share of its power in the real time market run by the independent system operator since the demise of the longer term california power exchange said jesus arredondo a spokesman for the exchange the state has been paying premium prices because it is buying in a market that was designed to handle last minute emergencies the governor s office has been seeking cheaper long term power contracts with only modest results   small electric producers ok big price cut by ed mendel staff writer february sacramento legislators said yesterday that small generators who produce about percent of the state s power have agreed to cut their power prices in half an important step toward easing the electricity crisis negotiations continued on what gov gray davis has called the final step the state purchase of the transmission systems of the three investor owned utilities in exchange for paying off their huge debt meanwhile the amount that the state is spending to buy power for the customers of the utilities grows officials gave notice that an additional million will be needed in days bringing the total to billion but for the first time in nearly six weeks the state did not declare an alert yesterday due to power shortages more power was available from other states and some power plants that had been shut down for maintenance resumed operation two legislators sen jim battin r palm desert and assemblyman fred keeley d boulder creek said they introduced legislation that sharply reduces the prices paid to small generators after weeks of difficult negotiations ultimately this bill will reduce the cost of energy to the state and its ratepayers by billions of dollars said battin who represents eastern san diego county about half of the small generators use renewable technologies such as solar wind geothermal and biomass the rest is co generation when fuel is used for industrial purposes and electricity is generated as a by product the small generators have grown to produce nearly a third of california s power under a two decade old federal qualifying facilities program which requires utilities to buy their power battin and keeley said that under the bill sb x the average price for these qf contracts could drop from the current cents per kilowatt hour to about to cents per kilowatt hour we believe that the rates are at least that low if not lower said jan smutny jones executive director of the independent energy producers which represents small and large generators the small generators support the bill because it will give them a stable price for five years avoiding ups and downs and the possibility that state regulators might make a more unfavorable price cut much of the current price formula is based on the price of natural gas at the california border which has soared this winter the legislation spreads the price bench mark over a five year period we encourage the legislature to take quick action to approve sb x as quickly as possible to help stabilize the electricity crisis smutny jones said he said one of the side agreements to the legislation is the creation of a portfolio of long term contracts to purchase natural gas for some co generators lowering their production costs the legislation was applauded as a major step forward by a group of small generators who formed a creditors committee last week and threatened to take the utilities into bankruptcy we call on the legislature and the governor to act on it immediately said chris thompson a spokesman for the group thompson said southern california edison continues to collect money from ratepayers as the state buys power for its customers but is not paying anything to the small non polluting generators a spokesman for a geothermal generator in el centro which filed a lawsuit seeking million from edison for power provided since november welcomed the legislation for giving generators stability and ratepayers cheaper power but vince signorotti a spokesman for calenergy said it would be premature to consider dropping the lawsuit battin and keeley said that payment of the small generators depends on the governor s attempt to negotiate the purchase of the transmission systems of edison pacific gas and electric and san diego gas and electric in exchange for payment of their debt as part of the governor s plan the utilities would agree to provide low cost power for five to years from their generators which provide about a third of the state s power davis aides are attempting to negotiate long term contracts with generators for the remaining third of the power required by the state sharply reducing the cost of buying power on the expensive spot market but the governor said this week that many generators are reluctant to sign long term contracts until they know how the utilities will pay their debt for previous power purchases the state called off all power alerts yesterday for the first time since mid january rescinding a stage alert declared wednesday grid operators made the change after increased power supplies became available the supply situation this week has gradually been improving said lorie o donley a spokeswoman with the california independent system operator which manages most of the state s power supplies however she said the improvements shouldn t deter consumers from conservation it is good news to be out of electrical emergencies but we just want to remind everybody that we are looking at a long term power supply situation here she said and the high demand summer is just around the corner so we would ask that people continue with their conservation efforts in san francisco yesterday state power regulators decided unanimously that the department of water resources is responsible for buying any power that cash strapped utilities are unable to generate or buy on their own no matter what price wholesalers are charging but the puc voted against taking action that would have allowed the dwr to receive a portion of ratepayer revenues from the utilities to help cover the cost of buying electricity the state through the dwr was authorized by a recent law to buy power for the utilities edison and pg e have such low credit ratings that no power companies will sell to them sdg e s rating is much better but its debt also was mounting the dwr purchases that portion of electricity beyond what the utilities provide through their own generating plants and through existing long term contracts but the dwr has refused to buy power beyond a certain price that means more last minute power purchases on the expensive spot market the utilities and the state had disagreed over how the dwr will be reimbursed whether through state bonds or ratepayer dollars and the extent of its power buying role the author of the bill authorizing the long term contracts assemblyman keeley said the legislation s intent was to fully cover the one third of the power that utilities purchased on the spot market either through extended contracts or through the state iso staff writer karen kucher and the associated press contributed to this report,0

got it thanks another article suggesting that we need to get our message out heard skilling and davis are going to talk he sign the bill yet best jeff power deregulation backfires in infancy many officials say it will work eventually by steve johnson mercury news with its residents reeling from surging summertime electricity bills this coastal state s deregulated energy market has triggered bitter accusations legislative hearings and a push to re regulate the whole system sound familiar except this isn t california it s new york one of other states that are ending what has been for decades one of government s key functions keeping tight control on the price of power the great national experiment to open the sale of electricity to competition which california has been largely credited with pioneering was supposed to lower prices by freeing consumers from the monopolistic grip of government regulated utilities indeed energy officials in many states retain hope that it eventually will do that but throughout the country a sense of foreboding has overtaken people like susan peckman who manages peckman s liquor store in pearl river n y hers is the only state outside california so far where consumers have been exposed to the discomfitting impact of fully deregulated prices and she doesn t feel liberated there s nothing we can do about it said peckman who estimated that her store s electricity bill has jumped about percent this summer over last year s faced with the option of paying it or closing down she added you re between a rock and a hard place it has been four years since california became one of the first states to pass an energy deregulation law yet the movement to revamp the way power is sold in this country remains mired in a prolonged and muddled transition according to a study published this month by cambridge energy research associates and the arthur andersen consulting firm it s unclear when or even if that transition will ever be completed in many parts of the country public officials are terrified of plunging ahead with deregulation given the high prices and other problems in california and new york some even harbor suspicions that california has led the nation astray by promoting an idea that is inherently flawed california public utilities commissioner henry duque said he encountered that attitude during a summer meeting of the national association of regulatory utility commissioners in los angeles i had other commissioners coming up to me saying what the hell is going on here duque said they were concerned i think their thought was did we in california see something that was wrong with deregulation but weren t going to level with them now that they had started down the path actually the federal government bears much of the responsibility for initiating the drive to ease public control of electricity markets hoping to encourage new sources of electricity congress passed laws in and that forced utility companies to buy increasing amounts of the power they use from other unregulated energy suppliers in the federal energy regulatory commission also made it possible for other firms to ship their power over the high voltage lines the utilities owned consumers were looking for a change too by the mid s the service provided by utility firms had become a sore subject california had some of the highest utility rates in the country and the electrical system s reliability was under fire if only other companies could be lured into the market to compete it was widely assumed prices would plummet and overall customer satisfaction would improve new york new hampshire and rhode island passed laws or made administrative rulings to deregulate slightly before california where deregulation was approved in september rhode island and massachusetts were first to give residents the ability to choose which company sold them their electricity but because of its size and much publicized deliberations about its plan to deregulate during the s california was labeled the national leader on the issue in many ways however deregulation in the state has been a flop at least so far californians have had the right to pick their energy supplier since march when the electricity market was officially unfettered that ability to choose was seen as an essential way to spur competition and ultimately lower energy prices but as of aug less than percent of california s homeowners businesses and others had seen fit to drop their local utility for some other supplier by contrast in pennsylvania one of other states that now let people choose percent of customers have switched critics say that s a misleading comparison since pennsylvania unlike california gives an energy price discount to consumers who make the switch nonetheless pennsylvania officials are clearly happy about how deregulation is working a study in august by pennsylvania gov tom ridge concluded that electricity competition will result in new jobs and a billion boost in personal income across the state by we do not anticipate the problems in pennsylvania that you have out there in california said kevin cadden a spokesman with that state s public utility commission i am not nervous at all a study this summer by the non profit center for the advancement of energy markets which promotes deregulation found that pennsylvania has pushed electricity competition more effectively and quickly than any other state others listed in order in the top were new york maine massachusetts texas nevada maryland rhode island new jersey and connecticut california was th but consumers may have a different measure of success whether their lights will stay on and how much electricity will cost them once government controls are removed unfortunately in the two states where prices have been fully deregulated the evidence is not encouraging in san diego the first place in california to have its state mandated cap on utility rates lifted under deregulation electricity bills for many consumers this summer doubled while power blackouts also rolled through northern california new york s experience wasn t quite as bad but in the few counties there that were exposed to fully deregulated electricity rates this summer the average residential bill rose percent investigations are under way in california and new york to determine what happened nonetheless the problems in both states have been largely blamed on an insufficient supply of power plants to meet their demand for electricity which has forced consumers to pay just about whatever power producing firms want to charge it s the piece that the economists missed when deregulation was touted several years ago said mike donovan a spokesman for orange and rockland utilities inc which supplies power to susan peckman s pearl river liquor store among other parts of new york there isn t sufficient generation to really administer a full scale competitive market ralph cavanagh of the national resources defense council in san francisco maintains that deregulation has been unfairly maligned because the dearth of power plants has made it impossible for consumers to benefit from competition once that and some other problems are fixed he said i m confident we ll have a more orderly market in the future others are growing nervous however this summer s difficulties have spurred calls to significantly stall or even reverse deregulation in north carolina nevada new mexico minnesota oregon and alabama among other states a wisconsin consumer advocate recently chuckled over the phone as she read aloud a story about california s energy crisis noting that such news made her opposition to deregulation much easier i am absolutely convinced that we are on an inexorable march toward the choice model said ken malloy president of the center for the advancement of energy markets but he acknowledged that the experience in san diego and new york is

possibility of privatizing of eskom s power stations has been raised for the first time electricity regulators announced in november that they were considering three bids for the first ipp license to

valued at billion will be first although it has been twice postponed all capacity additions will be solicited competitively as ipps under the boot build own operate transfer model this allows

decision would turn on a bid of less than cents kwh to generate power qatari nationals pay no power or water tariffs saudi arabia saudi arabia s demand growth has created a need for an additional gw of capacity by much of which will need to come from the private sector privatization of the sector is being considered as is an unbundling of g t d as a first step in february the ten power companies were merged in april the saudi electricity company was created as a joint stock company government owned the consensus among potential investors is that much needs to be done on the regulatory system the financial framework and on tariffs before ipps become feasible for instance nationals pay only nominal amounts for power early considerations of bot projects to meet soaring demand were shelved

andy good to hear there continue to be a proliferation of new systems coming online in the us two more start in the next two months we are pretty close to finalizing a plan to open our system to everyone in terms of accepting limit orders and posting best bid offer regardless of whose it is in this framework enron would sleeve credit for free should two third parties be matched on our system however we would hold the book getting to see what everyone was doing at all times the idea is that if we can move the industry s order flow from eol to eol we get a huge information advantage in addition to a couple trading advantages namely we have first priority on all numbers even if we are joining a limit bid posted by a counterparty before us and second we posess a proprietary stack manager that will allow us to transact on attractive limit orders faster than our competitors still working on technical issues the decision to open eol markets would be done on a product by product basis give me a call if you want to discuss andrew fairley am to john arnold hou ect ect cc subject re trip to houston john redmond i have now had a few weeks to implement some of your advice with regard to eol for uk gas we have managed to double our average daily volumes and are capturing a considerably greater share of the market we estimate now spectron are getting about of the number of trades we do there are still some counterparties who insist on paying through our numbers and paying brokerage so they do not show us what we are doing as far as we are concerned we only use spectronlive on uk gas when we are executing the strategy you mentioned below once again thanks for your help all the best andy john arnold  to andrew fairley lon ect ect cc subject re trip to houston andy enjoyed meeting with you one more thing i did not address my ultimate goal is to move all volume to eol however in addition to the nymex we have about other viable electronic trading systems we make it a point to never support these if possible we will only trade if the other system s offer is at or greater than our bid for instance if we are but have a strong inclination to buy and another system is at i will simultaneously lift their s and move my market to the lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the trade if i m bidding and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade to him people have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other systems because they will just get picked off if they don t post numbers on the other systems the systems get no liquidity and die i mention this because i have heard that enron is a fairly large trader on spectron s system i don t know whether it is in regards to gas power or metals just something to think about and maybe talk about with the other traders john andrew fairley am to phillip k allen hou ect ect john arnold hou ect ect scott neal hou ect ect thomas a martin hou ect ect barry tycholiz na enron enron keith holst hou ect ect cc david gallagher lon ect ect subject trip to houston thank you so much for your time last week david and i found the time especially valuable we have spotted several issues helpful for our own market this should certainly help in the growth of our markets here in europe we trust it won t be too long before we see similarly impressive results from our side of the pond best regards andy,0

wall street s dirty little secret it was the spring of i was just a tall goofy looking kid in middle school with buck teeth and freckles each day in the cafeteria i walked from table to table stealing other kids lunch money no i didn t rob them with a gun or a knife i just made them a little deal let me borrow two dollars today i said and i ll bring you five dollars next week the investment was too good to pass up and other kids were throwing their lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes of course when next week rolled around and i couldn t pony up the cash i promised to pay them even more the week after that if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit longer eventually the end of the year came and went high school started and with it came girls and homework and parties and sports and those poor kids from eighth grade had more things on their mind than last year s lunch money i made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid and i didn t even get beat up hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market secrets you will ever learn first of all greed is your number one enemy you re not going to turn into in a week so cash out when you re ahead don t wait for the boat to sink before grabbing the lifejacket second never trust an investment adviser of any kind they are looking out for their own money not yours the professionals those stuffy investment counselors and money managers will always tell you that the best time to buy is now according to those guys the longer you keep your money in the market the more money you re going to make ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is never in a sense they are right if you put in an index fund right now you ll probably have over a million dollars in thirty or forty years but here s the problem do you want to wait thirty or forty years to be rich hell no you want the money now so you can enjoy it it s hard to make use of your fortune when you re seventy years old in a wheelchair if you could make a million dollars in the next few years what would you do with it where would you travel what kind of car would you buy the fact is youth is the best time to be rich if your goal is to make quick profits in the market volatility is your ally and stability your enemy you want to see those large upswings two hundred points in a day followed by the four hundred point crash a week later you don t care if the market went up or down this year as long it was unstable that s how you re going to make the money what i m talking about here is day trading my father invests the traditional way he holds some good stocks and he goes up k and down k in the long term of years he makes money the day trader buys or sells shares of xyz for a profit in a minute trade he acts quickly taking advantage of all the information at his disposal about a certain stock and estimating whether it will go up or down within hours sometimes within minutes i can teach you how to do this and how to make amazing amounts of money at it it s not rocket science and you only need to learn a few basic principles to get started society would have you believe that successful trading is complicated and requires formal training the truth is wealthy people use very simple investment strategies to make money popular media and investment professionals portray successful trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing ring they don t want the competetion and they sure as hell don t want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm to execute a trade for which they d charge you forty or fifty dollars they make their money only if you believe two lies that investing is too difficult and risky for the average person that using an investment adviser who charges a high commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks per trade here is what the financial gurus in today s society absolutely positively do not want you to know the strategies for

urgent contact from the desk of dr tom eke e mail dr tomeke spinfinder com lagos nigeria attn request for urgent business relationship it is with my profound dignity that i write you this very important and highly confidential letter first i must solicit your strictest confidentiality in this transaction this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret though i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried considering the fact that we have not met each other before but i am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day we have decided to contact you by email due to the urgency of this transaction as we have been reliably informed that it will take at least a minimum of two to three weeks for a normal post to reach you so we decided it is best using the e mail which is quicker and also to enable us meet up with the second quater payment for the year however let me start by introducing myself properly to you i am dr tom eke a director general in the department of petroleum resources d p r and i presently head the contract award panel incharge of contract awards and payment approvals i came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential business transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence i and my colleagues are top officials of the federal government contract award panel our duties include evaluation vetting approval for payment of contract jobs done for the d p r e t c in order to commence this business we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said funds the source of this funds is as follows in the second quarter of this committee was mandated to review and award contracts to the tune of us million us dollars to a group of five firms for the supply construction and installation of oil pipe lines in warri and port harcourt during this process my colleagues and i decided and agreed among ourselves to deliberately over inflate the total contract sum from us million to us million united states dollars with the main intention of sharing the remaining sum of us miilion amongst ourselves the federal government of nigeria has since the second quater of year approved the sum of us million for us as the contract sum and the sum of us million has also been paid to the foreign companies concerned as contract entitlements for the various contracts done but since the companies are entiltled to us million dollars only we are now left with us million dollars balance in the account which we intend to disburse amongst ourselves but by virtue of our positions as civil servants and members of this panel we cannot do this by ourselves as we are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau civil service laws from opening and or operating foreign accounts in our names while still in government service making it impossible for us to acquire the money in our names right now i have therefore been delegated as a matter of trust and urgency by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner into whose account we would transfer the sum of us million hence we are writing you this letter my colleagues and i have agreed that if you or your company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our behalf you or your company will retain of the total amount us million while will be for us officials and the remaining will be used in offsetting all debts expenses and taxes incurred both local and foreign in the cause of this transfer needless to say the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous in return we demand your complete honesty and trust you must however note that this transaction will be strictly based on the following terms and conditions as we have stated below a our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence b that you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and confidentiality c that you will not ask for more share or try to sit on the funds once it is under your custody or any form of blackmail d that upon receipt of the funds you will release the funds as instructed by us after you have removed your share of from the total amount please note that this transaction is legal and risk free and we hope to conclude this transaction seven to fourteen bank working days from the date of receipt of the necessary requirements from you we are looking forward to doing business with you and solicit your total confidentiality in this transaction there is no cause for alarm i give you my word that you are completely safe in doing business with us transactions like this have been successfully carried out in the past by most government executives here in my country there is great economic and political disarray and thus looting and corruption is rampant and the order of the day thus explaining why you might have heard stories of how money is been taken out of nigeria this is because everyone is making desperate attempts to secure his or her future so that when we retire from active service we donot languish in poverty i will explain more to you when i have heard from you please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using the above e mail address i will bring you into the complete picture of this pending business transaction when i have heard from you and also receive your confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me fax to you all necessary information you need to know about our pending business transaction i will also send to you

i still had pimples george burns it s summer vacation time and parents will soon be hearing from their kids that they re bored one of the biggest regrets we hear from the older generation is that kids lack the playful imagination that was common a generation or two ago back in the olden days kids knew how to entertain themselves with surprisingly little there was no such thing as playstation kids

http www pocketwarmers com d just imagine by michael t smith when i married ginny i gained a new son daughter and four grandsons i became an instant grandpa over the july th holiday i got to meet my new daughter and her three boys for the first time it took a day for my new grandsons to warm up to me the first day they stared at me perhaps wondering what they were supposed to do with this man who they were told is grandpa i waited patiently i knew boys like to play they d come to me in their own time on day two the oldest two were doing summersaults over my lap the youngest ben took a little longer but yesterday he raced me across the yard thirty times and won every time the weekend brought back memories of my own childhood we had such imaginations in our minds a tree was a tower to spot approaching bad guys a big rock became a mountain a fallen log a space ship headed to the stars we had toys but we had to use our imagination not like the new toys i see my grandkids with our toys didn t talk and if they did you pulled a string to make it work we had blocks to build crayons to create trucks and cars to push they were simple toys that required imagination i thought about the toys in my garage the ones i saved when my children outgrew them they were simple and needed their imagination to work mr potato head allowed them to learn parts of the body and giggle at the funny face with an ear where its mouth should have been i still have an old plastic phone it has a dial to turn a bell that rings when you push a button and that s it it doesn t talk squawk beep or move around the room it s simple and was used when they played house nurse doctor and secretary i have a toy doctor s bag with all the plastic doctor s tools i remember all the broken bones cuts bangs scratches and aches my daughter repaired as i lay in her office moaning most toys today do it all we don t need imagination it comes in a box video games that take us into another world or reality talking toys with vocabularies better than most people computerized toys to teach the alphabet kids sit and have imagination brought to them the teaching toys are great but children tire of them it s like being in school when my son was young and tired of his toys he would come to me and say dad i m bored go find something to do i d reply i don t know what to do go outside and find a friend naaa i don t want to do that use your imagination huh he asked well when i was young you know the routine sports is the same we re entertained for hours watching someone else have fun doing what they re good at wouldn t it be better to be playing yourself if we don t like the sports available to watch we create new ones it doesn t matter what people will pay to see it because they need to be entertained i haven t heard of world championship worm digging but if someone offered a large cash price people would buy tickets to scream at the contestants i worry are we becoming a society that needs outside influence to have fun i think i ll go climb a tree maybe there s a pirate ship on the horizon or someone is attacking my castle just imagine michael t smith michael lives in new jersey with his new wife and son from our mailbag in response to last week s story cinderella men dear heartwarmers last week s heartwarming story opened a door to memory lane i too was born in the s and felt some of the poverty of that time i remember my mom and dad who never complained of the fatigue that was so ever present in their lives we were very fortunate in as much as we always had plenty of food and warm shelter we had a garden and salvaged every edible product available even certain weeds that were quite tasty after mother got all the spices in them i had several beautiful dresses made from feed sacks that i wore with pride we were very poor but so rich indeed because we had love and the knowledge that god was upper most in our lives and it taught us lessons that had never been printed in the books i deeply appreciate those lessons of long ago because they have taught me how to handle the tough times we have encountered in this life of prosperity and promise thank you again for your lovely

stephen white head up company dedicated to bringing the next generation of online gaming read full interview the asian market according to the diffusion group and game trust china will become the online gaming market by more investors are making huge gains as the world bets online could gaming transactions inc gtts be the next stock to rock recently we read an article in the economist that highlighted online gaming and how it has become a socially acceptable form of entertainment over the next few days as we thought about what sort of impact this trend could have we started to notice that online gambling was being discussed all over the media in newspapers online and on television it became obvious to us that more and more people were jumping on the internet to bet on games we also came across some staggering statistics merrill lynch for example has predicted that gambling has the potential to account for a full of global economic activity another source ecommercetimes com recently reported that the scope of this business is so enormous that some have even claimed that it is the single most important factor in the growth of e commerce the online gaming industry in other words appears to be booming and it may be an ideal time to is time to invest we decided to find out who the key players were in the business after speaking with a number of industry insiders the trail led us to an emerging publicly traded company called gaming transactions inc ggts after a close look at ggts we decided that this company could produce huge returns on investment in the upcoming months although ggts is a new company it has some surprisingly experienced players at the helm an uncommon thing to find in an industry only ten years old the company has come out with online versions of the addictive game keno and its management team was smart enough to secure the rights to the keno com website which if youre marketing keno is as good as it gets keno has the widest spread for the house of any mainstream gambling game ggts is also about to launch a suite of other online gambling games including poker and sports book betting once it offers these popular games and given that it already has keno com online the company could bring in great revenues attracting a lot of attention in the investment community and driving up its stock price after a successful north american launch gaming transactions inc gtts has translated its games into chinese and is about to hit asia this initiative looks like a wise business decision many analysis anticipate that china will be the biggest source of online gambling revenue by so the company could be poised for massive expansion in terms of both profits and global reach what does all this tell us a brand new company a popular well known game one of the biggest spreads for the house a growing market experienced management and a stock price that is trading under a dollar it adds up to the potential for huge gains for early investors if

internet success through simplicity every day of the week i get questions from people all over the world including my no bs gimg members wanting to know some of the most valuable secrets to my on going internet success let me say above all else i don t believe there are any true secrets to success on the net what you do to become successful in the online world is not a secret in my opinion most successful people follow simple clear repeatedly proven strategies to succeed whether on the net or off but when it comes to someone asking for advice consultation or simply asking what s your secret i have to blush say persistence and personality of course i always follow the advice with my own little disclaimer what makes me successful may not work the same for you your first lesson is to get over the deep seeded idea that success of any kind in my opinion is somehow an unknown unattainable secret clearly it is not it s not unknown it s not unattainable it s not years of digging to find the secrets to internet riches one thing that gets to me so often in my work as an internet consultant author and internet success strategist is that so many people on the net seem to have this incredibly huge mental block that stands between themselves and success on the net it s almost as if they ve been barraged by so many claims of what works and what doesn t work and so many long complicated routes to actually succeeding in their online venture that success is the equivelant of a foot high brick wall it s not that difficult my friends it is not that complicated long time friend and business associate rick beneteau has a new ebook out called branding you breaking the bank get it http www roibot com bybb cgi im bybtb but the reason i mention this is the fact that he talks so dynamically about the true simplicity of making your online venture a success and yes rick i come from the same school of self marketing marketing you obviously that s the core of his excellent new ebook and i couldn t agree with him more point being you are everything you do online to succeed you are your web site your business your marketing piece your customer service your customers experiences with your business all of it is you read his ebook you ll see more of what i m saying the matter at hand is that brick wall you might have standing high as you can see blocking the path between you internet success listen to me it is not real ok it doesn t exist there s nothing there to fear to begin with get over it what i m telling you is the only thing standing between you and the success you most desire is yourself when you realize this you will tear down that brick wall by means of complete and instantaneous disintegration it will no longer exist in your mind which is the only real place it ever was anyhow yes persistence and personality inherently includes honesty integrity accountability and many other qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate goals and realize that probably the most valuable powerful key to your success is you that may be the most incredible secret we ever uncover in our lifetime and trust me that brick wall won t ever get in your way again unless you let it talk about simple bryan is a veteran internet consultant author internet success strategist marketer he publishes mega success com chronicles to over

otc gdvi the momentum continues gdvi website debute otc bbalert gdvi news update global diversified industries debutes brand new website www gdvi net otc bb alert spectacular operating results momentum continues sales projections for next months surpasses million revenue increase net income increase stockholders equity increase increase in assets million order backlog million manufacturing capacity overview global diversified industries operates in the modular building construction industry and strategically targets the california education sector gdvi is strategically located in central california on acres with a square foot state of the art manufacturing facility throughout and the company focused on building its infrastructure through acquisitions development of a state of the art manufacturing facility and by securing the requisite financing facilities to fuel business growth through the combination of its new facility million capacity the increased demand for portable buildings and the state of california s bond approvals gdvi has become well positioned to become one of the dominant leaders in modular manufacturing on the west coast gdvi should benefit greatly from the billion school improvement bond that is expected to be passed by california voters next month march this presents in our opinion an opportunity for early investors of gdvi to also benefit before the mainstream investor realizes who the benefactors are and subsequently invests in those companies global diversified has taken numerous strategic development steps throughout and including generating strong revenues as well as profits and is now poised for explosive growth in the company is led by a strong management team with previous success in building companies into million per annum businesses in the past year gdvi has exceeded its own sales revenue projections renewed its piggyback contract received state approvals on engineered product designs started a new credit facility and opened its new square foot manufacturing facility the company will continue to seek new acquisition candidates through its aggressive growth plan profile gdvi is a holding company that currently operates two wholly owned subsidiaries mbs construction inc a modular contractor specializing in modular construction site work and renovation and global modular inc a sales marketing and manufacturing of modular type structures its principal customer base is currently educational public and private schools universities etc child care and municipality sectors its product lines consist of a variety of portable classroom designs including both single story and two story floor plans global modular s portable classroom structures are engineered and constructed in accordance with pre approved building plans commonly referred to as p c s or pre checked plans that conform to structural and seismic safety specifications administered by the california department of state architects dsa global modular also enjoys the benefit of providing educational customers with products contracted under a piggyback clause the state of california allows school districts to canvass proposals from modular classroom vendors under a bidding process where the successful bidder can provide other public school districts and municipalities portable classrooms under a piggyback contract issued by the originating school district this process saves school districts valuable time and resources from the necessity of soliciting bids a modular vendor who possesses a piggyback contract containing competitive pricing and a variety of design options may have access to future business for up to five years depending on the term of the piggyback contract the strategic focus on california schools since california legislation has required that at least of all new classrooms constructed with state funds be portable structures there are five compelling reasons for this trend modular classrooms are faster to construct as quickly as weeks they cost significantly less as low as vs they offer greater flexibility for use compared to conventional buildings they are easier to finance they provide financing incentives to cope with population growth the state department of education estimates that california will need more than classrooms each year for the next four years which equates to more than classrooms due to the current and projected budget cuts throughout the california education sector public and private schools are expected to turn to portable modular construction to fulfill their additional classroom requirements over the next four years the california schools budget crisis on november a billion school facilities improvements bond proposal proposition was passed by california voters this bond measure passage does not include an approximate billion worth of local bond measures passed by various school districts throughout the state a second bond measure worth billion went before the voters on the march these bond measures are about three times higher than the record billion bond california voters approved in the revenue generated from these bond measures will be used for school modernization programs which include requirements for relocatable classrooms and modular classroom construction and renovations money from the bonds will help overcrowded public and private schools design upgrades and expand building space at community colleges and other institutions of higher learning throughout california gdvi business infrastructure among global

to get this venture going method by sending bulk e mail legally let s say that you decide to start small just to see how it goes and we will assume you and those involved send out only e mails each let s also assume that the mailing receive only a of response the response could be much better but lets just say it is only also many peoplewill send out hundreds of thousands e mails instead of only each continuing with this example you send out only e mails with a response that is only orders for report those people responded by sending out e mail each for a total of out of those e mails only responded with orders that s people responded and ordered report those people mail out e mails each for a total of e mails the response to that is orders for report those people send e mail each for a total of million e mail sent out the response is orders for report those people send out e mails each for a total of million e mails the response to that is orders for report that s orders times each

mailed e mails each or more there are over million people on the internet worldwide and counting with thousands more coming on line every day believe me many people will do just that and more method by placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response we strongly suggest you start with method and add method as you go along for every you receive all you must do is e mail them the report they ordered that s it always provide same day

x bcc industry giants can t match this opportunity another ground breaking news alert from rlyc the potential stored value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately million people of which only about million now maintain active stored value debit card accounts one company is quickly entering a trillion market space with a proposed portfolio of product and service offerings that even the largest multi national corporations in its industry may have a hard time matching in just a few months this company has begun adding and developing innovative new products and targeting acquisitions that could help it reach millions of new long term customers that could generate tremendous re occurring revenues for many years to come although you have probably never heard of this company you may soon hear of it even if you don t continue reading this message that s because it is making a major push to put its products in the hands of a half million people in the u s within the next year an upstart company to make a real impact in a two trillion dollar industry in reality this company s lack of early recognition could be a major plus for you since the overwhelming majority of investors and institutions don t know this company or what they plan to accomplish their stock is trading at rock bottom prices but if they do accomplish even a small part of what they have set out to do over the coming months and years this company could become a significant player in its trillion dollar industry and its stock reflect its accomplishments the company that we ll introduce you to today is relay capital corp pink sheets rlyc rlyc which recently went public is a multi faceted financial services company that focuses primarily on the stored value card market rlyc s present product and service offerings include pre paid stored value cards reward cards employee payroll cards gift retail and affinity group cards travel cards and funds transfer cards these services are aimed at a significant market both domestically and internationally just because a company is in a large and growing industry doesn t necessarily ensure that it will be a winner in order to be successful that company also needs to be truly innovative have very strong partners be able to reach vast customer bases and have a management team capable of putting it all together and turning its goals into reality rlyc appears to be that company below we ll discuss this substantial potential market rlyc is after and what sets rlyc apart from the competition the potential stored value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately million people of which only about million now maintain active stored value debit card accounts stored value cards have the potential to help the million adults and their families who have been excluded from the e commerce revolution because they do not have access to credit or banking facilities the implications reverberate across industry segments estimates suggest stored value transactions could exceed trillion in just a few years rlyc s focus is on providing stored value cards to the un banked and under banked these terms refer to consumers that that do not have a bank account debit card the size of that group is staggering that s about one third of the nation s work force rlyc capitalizes on the dilemma these consumers face by providing stored value card programs that make it easy fast and secure for people and businesses to buy all manners of goods and services using stored value cards as well as for the un banked and under banked to be paid their salaries via the same cards but that s not all the benefits relay will offer on its stored value cards as well as other financial services will also be of great benefit to those who already have banking relationships in this segment relay plans to offer more services with greater convenience for less cost to the consumer who wouldn t want that the payroll market is another enormous market for rlyc for the under and un banked collecting their pay cashing payroll checks and then paying bills with those funds can be extremely complicated and time consuming rlyc s stored value pay transfer card program presents a very effective and innovative solution for this problem rlyc s pay transfer card program can lower costs to employers to process payroll for the banked and the un banked alike lower costs to cardholders to potentially transfer cash between u s cards cards in foreign countries and services bought through the cards improved employee retention improved customer retention will all be available thanks to rlyc various programs will make life much easier for cardholders using the system while also providing the convenience and flexibility of either visa or mastercard purchasing power or hour access to their money through atms rlyc signs loi with national staffing company to use its pay transfer cards earlier this year rlyc signed a binding letter of intent to provide a pay transfer card program for asgard global resources llc click to go to their site a leader in providing technical craft and administrative staffing services to businesses industry and government through locations in houston dallas long island orlando phoenix and southern california all areas with huge un and under banked populations the potential market for this service is really big it includes large employers companies that process payroll and financial institutions that provide banking and payroll services to commercial customers this system will simplify payments to widely dispersed employees and contractors while dramatically decreasing payroll distribution by offering a cost effective alternative to printing cutting and mailing paper payroll checks it also helps to reduce a great deal of paper processing of checks and pay eliminate lost checks stop payments and minimize fraud but best of all this should help to significantly boost rlyc s revenues billion sent worldwide by relatives to home countries mexicans in u s send billion a year back to mexico with billion being transferred internationally each year remittances are a really big business in times past people wanting to send money to relatives back in their home countries had few choices many times their only choice was an expensive proposition like western union more recently more and more people have resorted to purchasing and mailing money orders in order to try to cut down on the cost of sending remittances the problems with traditional money transfer methods with wire services there are any number of inherent problems when trying to send money to relatives overseas first wiring funds across borders can be expensive this can make it very cost prohibitive to send smaller amounts of cash and often means that relatives must wait longer to receive their remittances because the sender has to save up until the amount is large enough to warrant the cost associated with the wire service next there is the problem of logistics both the sender and the recipient must be able to easily reach a storefront that offers the same wire company s services even if they both are able to do this the recipient may have to make multiple trips to the wire service office to check to see if their funds have cleared yet and can be released to them lastly the sender and the recipient are subjected to varying service fees depending on which wire service they choose these fees can be very high and can significantly cut into the amount of money the recipient ultimately receives so even though using a wire service may be a fairly fast way to transfer money it can be very expensive and logistically difficult to use with money orders there is always the problem of mail service although in america we have grown accustomed to relatively quick and reliable mail service this is not always the case in foreign countries this is especially true in underdeveloped nations where most remittances are sent a letter containing a remittance that a family is depending on to provide much needed food and shelter could take many days or even weeks to arrive and there is always the chance that it will never arrive at its destination at all meaning that the sender s family could go hungry or end up on the streets what is the best way to send remittances by far the most convenient fast safe and ultimately cost efficient method to send remittances is through a stored value card with this type of service a person can easily activate a card and then just deposit funds into the account onto the card via loading station telephone or the internet for easy use by relatives in his or her home country the process is extremely easy and cost effective funds can be added to the card s account at an ever increasing number of convenient locations the family member overseas can then draw down on those funds by presenting a card from that account to make purchases or they can use the card to withdraw cash from atms it could not be any simpler rlyc has already begun filling orders in june of this year rlyc announced that it had received its first order for pin based

capital hill gold chgi potential high grade gold deposit breaking news denver june business wire capital hill gold inc chgi reports that the company s geologists are evaluating a potential high grade bulk tonnage gold deposit located in mineral county nevada the project is situated in the vicinity of several operating and past producing gold mines including the paradise peak santa fe and rawhide deposits after review of usgs geochemical survey work of the project and a study of the geology of other gold deposits in the area geologists believe that the target would be a high grade bulk tonnage gold deposit virgin deposits the privately held acre project was originally staked by a major gold mining company in the s the property has never been drilled and may prove to be a rich vein as early tests have indicated follow up work by the company s geologist indicated that a major international gold mining company had staked approximately unpatented lode mining claims in the area during and geologists investigating the property for capital hill observed multiple broad zones of silicification extending for considerable distances samples were collected from several outcrops on the property and have been submitted to american assay labs in elko nevada for assaying based on positive assay results target and identification a major claim staking program will be launched accordingly as further credible evidence emerges of a significant gold ore deposit and the first results coming in are showing promise on june the company announced in a press release that capital hill s management is pleased and encouraged with the first u o uranium oxide assay returns as well as the noticeable precious metal results and that initial reconnaissance sampling on the company s uranium project has returned assays grading u o to u o of great interest to the company is the fact that the samples taken also assayed positively for precious metals with results ranging from to oz ag st and trace amounts of gold the occurrence of silver in conjunction with the uranium mineralization warrants further investigation the recent news of the company possibly sitting on a huge untapped gold deposit has the stock in a strong up trend rallying from cents to cents during the past three months as the three month chart illustrates trading volume has swelled to shares per day with money flow indicators showing strong inflows which is representative of a stock that is under accumulation the positive tape action clearly shows strong investor sentiment about the company s leverage on controlling sizable parcels of gold fields the potential recoverable gold data has yet to be compiled but as mentioned above early tests are very promising which is why investors are bidding up shares ahead of this data capital hill gold s strategic objective is to obtain controlling interests in properties with excellent exploration potential to become economically significant to world class ore deposits chgi intends to acquire mineral exploration properties primarily through the filing of concessions on its own account and in partnership as well as by optioning exceptional properties at reasonable costs relative to the property s potential and the financial capabilities of the company in recent weeks chgi shareholders have been on the receiving end of some very promising developments with the new discoveries for gold ore in addition the company is aggressively exploring for commercial grade uranium deposits that will supply newly heightened demand from nuclear utilities since uranium prices have doubled of the world s electricity comes from uranium and the nuclear power plant count is stable and growing the united states needs to add about nuclear power plants over the next two decades to meet burgeoning demand for electric power and maintain the current generating mix nils j diaz chairman of the u s nuclear regulatory commission told reporters in early may as of may the company is pleased to report that the claim staking crew and geologist have arrived on site and have begun staking claims the area being staked encompasses a large area of potentially commercial grade uranium mineralization identified by previous work including geophysical surveys reconnaissance sampling of the ground being staked has returned assay results approximately equal to those of in place resources at one of the past producing uranium mines in the project area a chinese news web site reports that china the world s second largest energy consumer after the u s will spend billion yuan u s billion on building new nuclear power plants by this is a bigger number than we have seen in the past the energy hungry country intends to increase the amount of installed nuclear power capacity from the current gigawatts to gigawatts within years nuclear power generation is expected to triple to reach gigawatts by that time so the market for uranium is in a new bull market conclusion development efforts for gold and uranium on chgi properties are about to commence following the better than expected geophysical testing results shares of chgi have rallied over fold in just the past three months in anticipation of what the future holds in the way of extractible gold and uranium once full mining operations are under way it is our view that the shares will rally as the business generates its initial revenue stream for additional information visit investor relations solutions is a communications arm of ir solutions profiles investor relations solutions is not

attics crawl spaces etc than lecture on fast and loose applications of code something about cents a bd ft installed meeting all codes and spray applied many companies we talk to have a product that appears to be perfect but they haven t spent the money to test over foam maybe a small committee could do a evaluation of various products report results to spfa who in turn will acquire funding from us william b australia we are in australia but we are finding it hard to locate polyurea sprayers here so that we can start a chapter of the pda do u have any list of australian contractors suppliers or maybe they can put their hand up and lets us know at enviroline powerup com au it isfor the betterof the game that an association is need to inform clients and specifiers of the uses and properties

publication that just launched this month i need any new processes you might have that would be used on aircraft particularly commercial aviation john c louisiana i have a foam cat graco machine and a probler gun with a tip i use this setup to spray truck bed liners my question is can i and how do i spray foam insulation using my equipment and what are the different types of insulation murph mahaffey glas craft i like the new look of the industry forum mark w south carolina i m sick of all this garbage about covering foam with a thermal barrier what the hell do you think foam is if you are saying that anything that can be forced to burn should be covered with a fireproof barrier then you d better get busy covering all those trusses and joists and plywood up there that are definitely not carrying a class one fire rating this double standard for foam is coming directly from those who stand to lose business from it icynene is different it doesn t burn alone it doesn t melt it doesn t emit phosgene does it smoke in a fire situation sure so what blaming foam in the attic for a house fire because it forces the foam to eventually burn is about as stupid as blaming foam seat cushions for burning when a gas tank ruptures and burns up a car get real inspectors you want us to cover up the only thing in the attic assembly that doesn t burn as for the vaunted r rating system it is totally bogus the test is designed to make porous insulations appear to perform better than they actually do measuring only conduction and ignoring convection and radiant to convective transfer the test should have been thrown out for the industry lackey it is years ago along with that obsolete fiberglassgarbage they re still selling everybody there s a reason they don t make refrigerators freezers coolers coffee cups out of fiberglass or cellulose think about it dirk benthien forum moderator thank you mark and dik for your statements above i also feel that far too often individuals and

television making over a half million dollars every months from your home for an investment of only us dollars expense one time thanks to the computer age and the internet be a millionaire like others within a year before you say no way read the following this is the letter you ve been reading about in the news lately due to the popularity of this letter on the internet a major nightly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of the program described below to see if it really can make people money the show also investigated whether or not the program was legal their findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in this program this has helped to show people that this is a simple harmless and fun way to make some extra money at home and besides even if you never got involved in the program the reports themselves are well worth the money they can help you start and advertise any business on the internet that is these reports stand alone and are beneficial to anyone wishing to do business on the internet the results of this show have been truly remarkable so many people are participating that those involved are doing much better than ever before since everyone makes more as more people try it out its been very exciting to be a part of it lately you will understand once you experience it here it is below print this now for future reference the following income opportunity is one you may be interested in taking a look at it can be started with very little investment and the income return is tremendous this is a legitimate legal money making opportunity it does not require you to come into contact with people do any hard work and best of all you never have to leave your house except to get the mail simply follow the instructions and you really can make this happen this e mail order marketing program works every time if you put in the effort to make it work e mail is the sales tool of the future take advantage of this non commercialized method of advertising now the longer you wait the more savvy people will be taking your business using e mail get what is rightfully yours program yourself for success and dare to think big it sounds corny but it s true you ll never make it big if you don t have this belief system in place multi level marketing mlm has finally gained respectability it is being taught in the harvard business school and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between and of all goods and services will be sold through multi level methods this is a multi billion dollar industry and of the millionaires in the u s made their fortune in the last several years in mlm moreover statistics show people become millionaires everyday through multi level marketing you may have heard this story before but donald trump made an appearance on the david letterman show dave asked him what he would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch without hesitating trump said he would find a good network marketing company and get to work the audience started to hoot and boo him he looked out at the audience and dead panned his response that s why i m sitting up here and you are all sitting out there with network marketing you have two sources of income direct commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you introduce to the business residual income is the secret of the wealthy it means investing time and money once and getting paid again and again and again in network marketing it also means getting paid for the work of others the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers fortunately sometime later i reread everything and gave some thought and study to it my name is jonathan rourke two years ago the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down sized and my position was eliminated after unproductive job interviews i decided to open my own business over the past year i incurred many unforeseen financial problems i owed my family friends and creditors over the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just couldn t seem to make ends meet i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business at that moment something significant happened in my life and i am writing to share that experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially in mid december i received this program via e mail six month s prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities all of the programs i received in my opinion were not cost effective they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year it didn t tell me i d have to write a book to make it but like i was saying in december i received this program i didn t send for it or ask for it they just got my name off a mailing list thank goodness for that after reading it several times to make sure i was reading it correctly i couldn t believe my eyes here was a money making phenomenon i could invest as much as i wanted to start without putting me further into debt after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out i would at least get my money back but like most of you i was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all so i checked it out with the u s post office hrs and they confirmed that it is indeed legal after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter i decided why not initially i sent out e mails it cost me about for my time on line the great thing about e mail is that i don t need any money for printing to send out the program and because all of my orders are filled via e mail the only expense is my time i am telling you like it is i hope it doesn t turn you off but i promised myself that i would not rip off anyone no matter how much money it cost me here is the basic version of what you need to do your first goal is to receive at least orders for report within weeks of your first program going out if you don t send out more programs until you do your second goal is to receive at least orders for report within weeks if not send out more programs until you do once you have your orders relax you ve met your goal you will make but keep at it if you don t get right off keep at it it may take some time for your down line to build keep at it stay focused and do not let yourself get distracted in less than one week i was starting to receive orders for report i kept at it kept mailing out the program and by january had received orders for report my first step in making in days was done by january had received orders for report more than i needed so i sat back and relaxed by march of my e mailing of i received with more coming in every day i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car please take time to read the attached program it will change your life forever remember it won t work if you don t try it this program does work but you must follow it exactly especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place it won t work you ll lose out on a lot of money in order for this program to work very fast try to meet your goal of orders for report and orders for report and you will make or more in days if you don t reach the first two goals with in four weeks relax you will still make a ton of money it may take a few months or so longer but keep mailing out the programs and stay focused that s the key i am living proof that it works if you choose not to participate in this program i am sorry it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you if you choose to participate follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security if you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble like i was or you want to start your own business consider this a sign i did sincerely jonathan rourke p s do you have any idea what bills look like piled up on a kitchen table it s awesome a personal note from the originator of this program by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports you should have concluded that such a program and one that is legal could not have been created by an amateur let me tell you a little about myself i had a profitable business for years then in my business began falling off i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me but it wasn t working finally i figured it out it wasn t me it was the economy inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since i don t have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate because many of you know from first hand experience there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before the middle class was vanishing those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up those who did not including those who never had anything to save or invest were moving down into the ranks of the poor as the saying goes the rich get richer and the poor get poorer the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to move up or get rich inflation will see to that you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life with no risk and just a little bit of effort you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined follow the program exactly as instructed do not change it in any way it works exceedingly well as it is now remember to e mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of one of the people you send this to may send out and your name will be on everyone of them remember though the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach so my friend i have given you the ideas information materials and opportunity to become financially independent it is up to you now think about it before you delete this program from your mailbox as i almost did take a little time to read it and really think about it get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it you will still make a lot of money you will definitely get back what you invested any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in it works jody jacobs richmond va here s how this amazing program will make you thousands of dollar this method of raising capital really works every time i am sure that you could use up to or more in the next days before you say no way please read this program carefully this is not a chain letter but a perfectly legal money making opportunity basically this is what you do as with all multilevel businesses we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multilevel business partners and we offer a product for every dollar sent your orders come by mail and are filled by e mail so you are not involved in personal selling you do it privately in your own home store or office this is the greatest multi level mail order marketing anywhere this is what you must do order all reports shown on the list below you can t sell them if you don t have them for each report send cash the name number of the report you are ordering your e mail address and your name return address in case of a problem make sure your return address is on your envelope in case of any mail problems when you place your order make sure you order each of the five reports you need all five reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them within a few days you will receive via e mail each of the five reports save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the s of people who will order them from you important do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report or their order on the list in any way other than as instructed below in steps a through g or you will lose out on the majority of your profits once you understand the way this works you ll also see how it doesn t work if you change it remember this method has been tested and if you alter it it will not work a look below for the listing of available reports b after you ve ordered the five reports take this advertisement and remove the name and address under report this person has made it through the cycle and is

a better investment than the stock market all our mailings are sent complying to the proposed h r unsolicited commercial electronic mail act of please see the bottom of this message for further information and removal instructions parents of year old find cash hidden in his closet does this headline look familiar of course it does you most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program usa and reported elsewhere in the world including my neck of the woods new zealand his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her year old sons closet nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash five dollar bills twenties fifties and hundreds all neatly rubber banded in labelled piles my first thought was that he had robbed a bank says the year old woman there was over dollars in that bag that s more than my husband earns in a year the woman immediately called her husband at the car dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered he came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet as it turns out the boy had been sending out via e mail a type of report to e mail addresses that he obtained off the internet everyday after school for the past months he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom i just got the e mail one day and i figured what the heck i put my name on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out says the clever year old the e mail letter listed addresses and contained instructions to send one dollar bill to each person on the list then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses down and finally to add your name to the top of the list the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five dollar bills within weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the address list i get junk e mail all the time and really did not think it was going to work the boy continues within the first few days of sending out the e mail the post office box that his parents had gotten him for his video game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines but envelopes containing bills about a week later i rode my bike down to the post office and my box had magazine and about envelops stuffed in it there was also a yellow slip that said i had to go up to the post office counter i thought i was in trouble or something laughs he goes on i went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me i had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all over the next few weeks the boy continued sending out the e mail the money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet barely had time for my homework he had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the bills for twenties fifties and hundreds i didn t want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack i would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me one time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it but i just rode to the next bank down the street laughs surprisingly the boy did not have any reason to be afraid the reporting news team examined and investigated the so called chain letter the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain letter at all in fact it was completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws title section and or title section in the us code also in the code of federal regulations volume sections and which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received every five dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read please send me report number xyx this simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service a report on how to for a five dollar fee this is the end of the media release if you would like to understand how the system works and get your please continue reading what appears below is what the year old was sending out on the net you can use it too just follow the simple instructions be financially free like others within a year before you say bull please read the following this is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately due to the popularity of this letter on the internet a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below to see if it really can make people money the show also investigated whether or not the program was legal their findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple instructions they are bound to make some megabucks with only out of pocket cost due to the recent increase of popularity respect this program has attained it is currently working better than ever note follow the directons below i had best results the second time when i hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions in order for all of us to be successful many many emails must be sent so that the returns are many i have been extremely successful using the following company they send out the offers and all i do is accept money for reports then i send back to the people as soon as possible this is what one had to say thanks to this profitable opportunity i was approached many times before but each time i passed on it i am so glad i finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required to my astonishment i received total in weeks with money still coming in pam hedland fort lee new jersey here is another testimonial this program has been around for a long time but i never believed in it but one day when i received this again in the mail i decided to gamble my on it i followed the simple instructions and walaa weeks later the money started to come in first month i only made but the next months after that i made a total of so far in the past months by re entering the program i have made over and i am playing it again the key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and not change anything more testimonials later but first print this now for your future reference order all reports shown on the list below for each report send cash the name number of the report you are ordering and your e mail address to the person whose name appears on

alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report or their sequence on the list in any way other than what is instructed below in step through or you will loose out on majority of your profits once you understand the way this works you will also see how it does not work if you change it remember this method has been tested and if you alter it will not work people have tried to put their friends relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money but it does not work this way believe us we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened so do not try to change anything other than what is instructed because if you do it will not work for you remember honesty reaps the reward after you have ordered all reports take this advertisement and remove the name address of the person in report this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune move the name address in report down to report move the name address in report down to report move the name address in report down to report move the name address in report down to report insert your name address in the report position please make sure you copy every name

assist you with marketing your business on the internet the reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e mails legally where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more there are primary methods to get this venture going method by sending bulk e mail legally let s say that you decide to start small just to see how it goes and we will assume you and those involved send out only e mails each let s also assume that the mailing receive only a response the response could be much better but lets just say it is only also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e mails instead of only each continuing with this example you send out only e mails with a response that is only orders for report those people responded by sending out e mail each for a total of out of those e mails only responded with orders that equals people responded and ordered report those people mail out e mails each for a total of e mails the response to that is orders for report those people send out e mails each for a total of million e mails sent out the response to that is orders for report those people send out e mails each

and figure out the worst possible responses and no matter how you calculate it you will still make a lot of money remember friend this is assuming only people ordering out of you mailed to dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one th of those people mailed e mails each or more there are over million people on the internet worldwide and counting believe me many people will do just that and more method by placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response we strongly suggest you start with method and add method as you go along for every you receive all you must do is e mail them the report they ordered that s it always provide same day service on all orders this will guarantee that the e mail they send out with your name and address on it will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report order each report by its number name only notes always send cash u s currency for each report checks not accepted make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least

make pretty good money when i received this program i grumbled to jody about receiving junk mail i made fun of the whole thing spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved i knew it wouldn t work jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet i made merciless fun of her and was ready to lay the old i told you so on her when the thing didn t work well the laugh was on me within weeks she had received responses within the next days she had received total all cash i was shocked i have joined jody in her hobby mitchell wolf chicago illinois not being the gambling type it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan but conservative that i am i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i wouldn t get enough orders to at least get my money back i was surprised when i found my medium size post office box crammed with orders i made in the first weeks the nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live there simply isn t a better investment with a faster return and so big dan sondstrom alberta canada i had received this program before i deleted it but later i wondered if i should have given it a try of course i had no idea who to contact to get another copy so i had to wait until i was e mailed again by someone else months

breaking biotech news genethera inc to collaborate with biotech giant beckman coulter inc genethera news release july th genethera inc otc bb gtha a molecular biotech company located in wheat ridge co granted first right of refusal to beckman coulter inc nyc bec to license genethera s patented technology for developing live animal genetic diagnostic tests this is a significant milestone for genethera beckman coulter is one of the world s leading manufacturers of biomedical testing systems tests and supplies our collaboration will unite the expertise of beckman coulter with the cutting edge technology of genethera dr antonio milici m d ph d genethera inc genethera provides genetic diagnostic solutions for the veterinary and agricultural industries with future plans to include the healthcare industry the company was formed to realize the commercial potential of molecular diagnostic assays using roche s f pcr technology to detect the presence of infectious disease from the blood of animals particularly live animals this platform enables genethera to offer tests that are presently not available from any other technology future plans include all infectious disease potentially affecting domesticated livestock as well as wildlife intended for human consumption with priority being given to mad cow johne s and foot and mouth diseases in cattle genethera has successfully

kits and services for more information visit www beckmancoulter com we are looking forward to working with genethera to identify commercial applications of their technology chris neary general manager prion business center beckman coulter inc in most countries around the globe the discovery of a cow with mad cow disease leads to the immediate slaughter of hundreds even thousands of cattle out of wide spread fear of disease spread and the need to complete disease testing on the dead animals costly international beef recalls are common since mad cow testing until now has only been conducted after the slaughter process genethera s live animal blood test could lead to halting of mass slaughters and widespread panic while saving the industry hundreds of millions of dollars each year through the testing of a single blood sample genethera could end the need to slaughter entire herds of cattle and other animals for disease testing saving the industry hundreds of millions of dollars each year currently funded by an institutional money manager in southern california genethera has plans to open laboratories worldwide to meet this exploding bse testing demand you want to invest in the

genethera technology genethera s business is based on its integrated technology platform itp that combines a proprietary diagnostic solution called gene expression assay gea tm with purivax tm its system for analyzing large scale dna sequencing the first part of this platform is the ongoing development of molecular diagnostic assays solutions using real time fluorogenic polymerase chain reaction f pcr technology to detect the presence of infectious disease from the blood of live animals the second part of the itp is the development of therapeutic vaccines using rna interference technology it also allows for the efficient effective and continuous testing management and treatment of animal populations these facts distinguish the technology from any alternative testing and management methodology available to agriculture today all of which require the destruction of individual animals and even entire herds our testing and data analysis processes also allow us not only to separate infected from clean animals but also to gain knowledge vital to development of preventative vaccines genethera inc is committed to providing global access to cutting edge biotechnology services to fellow scientists in academia the pharmaceutical industry and the biotechnology industry primarily genethera s expertise focuses on technology relevant to animal and human immunotherapy

vaccines for such blood born diseases it also allows for the efficient effective and continuous testing management and treatment of animal populations these facts distinguish the technology from any alternative testing and management methodology available to agriculture today all of which require the destruction of individual animals and even entire herds our testing and data analysis processes also allow us not only to separate infected from clean animals but also to gain knowledge vital to development of preventative vaccines to date genethera has successfully developed the assay ability to detect mad cow and chronic wasting disease a disease affecting elk and deer in north america diagnostic assays for e coli ol h and johnne s disease are in the final stages of development vaccines for e coli ol h and johnne s disease both of which are diseases affecting cattle are in advanced stages of development in the future the company plans to expand assay application research to a wide range of diseases animals the immediate targets being mad cow hoof mouth west nile and newcastle genethera can detect bse using the companies patented live animal blood test that evaluates the e d r f gene sequence the e d r f gene is proven to decrease dramatically before any tse infection is noticeable in a live animal or human the patent gtha holds is broad based and can detect all tse diseases including mad cow bse in cattle cwd in elk deer and creutzfeld jacobs in humans the company s patented test can detect these diseases faster than any other method developed in the marketplace and at far less a cost the test can also be used on a mass scale using roche f pcr dna analyzing robotics equipment genethera can analyze over blood samples a day with one f pcr machine and a single technician the project will prove highly profitable at approx per test when wide scale commercialization is under way a multi billion dollar international demand for commercial mad cow testing has emerged around the globe japan conducted million post mortem rapid mad cow tests last year alone they used the western blot developed by prionics ag in swizterland and bio rad s rapid test costs are between and dollars per test most importantly other tests in the marketplace cannot detect the disease until the animal has been killed testing through post mortem brain tissue exams is extremely labor intensive and costly japan spent between million million on million post mortem rapid mad cow tests in genethera s simple blood test can be collected using their patented field collection system the sample is then mailed to the lab for testing the company also stated in their recent k that they are currently in negotiations with strategic testing partners that we believe will absorb the costs

re wall street micro news report homeland security investments the terror attacks on the united states on september have changed the security landscape for the foreseeable future both physical and logical security have become paramount for all industry segments especially in the banking national resource and government sectors according to giga a wholly owned subsidiary of forrester research worldwide demand for information security products and services is set to eclipse b by homeland security investments is a newsletter dedicated to providing our readers with information pertaining to investment opportunities in this lucrative sector as we know events related to homeland security happen with lightning speed what we as investors can do is position ourselves in such a way as to take advantage of the current trends and be ready to capitalize on events which have yet to happen homeland security investments is here to help our readers do just that with this in mind it is with great excitement that we present vinoble inc this stock is expected to do big things in both the near and long terms symbol vnbl current price short term target price month target price why we believe vnbl ob will give big returns on investment at this time much of vnbl s focus is on rfid radio frequency identification technology this is technology which uses tiny sensors to transmit information about a person or object wirelessly vnbl is already an industry pioneer in the rfid personal location technology vnbl is developing a form of rfid technology which allows companies and governments to wirelessly track their assets and resources such technology has huge potential in the protection and transportation of materials designated high risk were they to fall into the wrong hands vnbl works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in order to create high security space in locales where it is deemed necessary locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports sea ports mines nuclear facilities and more as with all stocks news drives the short term price fresh news has made vnbl a hot buy news on vnbl malibu calif business wire june vinoble inc otcbb vnbl news a holding company seeking to identify long term growth opportunities in the areas of homeland security security information systems and other security services announced today that it plans to offer products and services that will assist in the automation of the identification and control of equipment assets tools and the related processes used in the oil gas and petrochemical industries although small wirelessly networked rfid sensors can monitor machines and equipment to detect possible problems before they become serious they can also deliver safety features within oil wells oil maybe trapped in different layers of rock along with gas and water detection of specific liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur such as a well filling with water as with other rf based technology applications rfid can also provide the safe transit of materials by only the authorized handler and limit the entry of personnel to specific locations ensuring personnel safety is essential should there be an emergency at a facility rfid tags would enable the customer to track and evaluate its employee s safety and or danger this application technology requires product and hardware that can operate in harsh and potentially hazardous conditions but gives valuable safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer rfid can also assist the customer s supply chain by tracking oil gas and chemical products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retail level vinoble s viewpoint as previously stated is that these applications are more than just a valuable tool to the mining industry but as a protective measure of our country s natural resources and commodities against threat preservation of these fuels and resources is important to the safety of u s industry and economy the company believes that such offering service and technology application in the oil gas and petrochemical industry will further position vinoble in a rapidly expanding industry while taking advantage of access to the increasing capital and global spending that the company will require for growth the company s goal is to also provide a much needed service at a cost manageable to even the smallest of businesses that can t afford to do without the safety of its personnel and assets in

reduction in road accidents august dear sir madam in case you have received this mail earlier kindly ignore this mail it may have been re sent to you by mistake ours is not a mailing list and we have no intention of sending any regular mails to anybody we have devised a set of systems which can reduce the damage caused to vehicles and deaths and injury caused to passengers and pedestrians in vehicular accidents by more than seventy five percent we have already filed and are in process of filing further multiple and appropriate disclosure documents provisional patent applications at the united states patent trademarks office uspto and also applications under the patent co operation treaty at world intellectual property organization wipo at geneva there is absolutely no doubt that our idea is new and innovative moreover we are very confident and very sure that this will help reducing minimizing human suffering to a very large extent there is no doubt that the product devised by us will change the face of the earth forever brief details relating to our product are detailed in the annexures under the following headings statistics advantages options economics we are looking for the followings business consultancy and advice regarding the most viable practical and profitable course of action under the circumstances and also consultancy on patents one person moderately injured every three seconds one person mildly injured every three seconds c current yearly automobile sales worldwide more than billion us d number of automobiles worldwide more than billion pieces e daily loss caused due to vehicular accidents worldwide more than billion us per day of the worldwide gross national product of more than billion us more than us per year more than billion us per day theadvantages of the technology developed by us a the introduction of such technology will dramatically reduce the expenses of auto insurance this reduction of insurance cost will be at par with or even more that the expenses incurred towards the introduction of such technology in modern day vehicles accordingly the life insurance premier will also undergo drastic reduction additionally because of saving of lives the outgo of the insurance companies will reduce substantially b as per the who studies and projections road accidents occupy the number nine positions by way of causes of death in the world today it is projected by who that by the year they will occupy the number three positions next only to heart disease and depression by introduction of this technology we are sure that this will not happen on the contrary there will be massive reduction in the number of deaths due to road accidents and road accidents may not figure on the list of major causes of death in the year at all c this technology will therefore make all vehicles cheaper and safer not only will the cost be reduced safety which is priceless in itself will also be greatly enhanced as and when the regular patent application is filed and patent is granted the life of the patent will be years even at the current levels with road accidents placed at number nine on the who list as a major cause of death there is a daily loss of two billion us even at the present level over a period of twenty years without any interest and without any compounding this loss works out to be billion us x days x years billion us d our technology will ensure that at least seventy five percent of the above losses are prevented such figure works out to be more that billion us it is important to note that this is the projection at the current level as per the future projections the incidents of road accidents are expected to increase hence the figure is likely to be increase very substantially in addition the time factor and the interest factor will inflate this figure further e at the current levels more than million persons are dying every year due to road accidents even at the current rates more than million lives will be lost in road accidents over the next twenty years i e life of the patent when granted besides at the current levels million people are injured every year in the next twenty years the number of people injured due to road accident will therefore be more than half a billion f if we add to that the personal physical and psychological traumas to those directly involved in and also to those who are associated with the people involved in the road accidents the trauma and the misery and henceforth the value of the savings are all unmeasurable in quantities presently known to human kind g considering the figures and dynamics as explained hereinabove it may not be improper or out of place to compare this technology with the introduction of electricity computer or aircrafts in terms of its value to mankind h the benefits of this technology will be so obvious and essential that in the very near future the use of this technology will become unavoidable it should and will become mandatory by law to install such technology and the installation of such technology should and will be a pre requisite for granting or renewal of the registration and license of all vehicles in future i as described hereinabove this technology and its utility are incomparable outthought of and unheard of till date it will open a new floodgate in human travel and safety measures in future it can and will be applied to other mode of transport like aircrafts and trains also among other things we have the following options available to us options available to us a outright sale a immediate outright sale of the idea and the concept along with our filed applications for one time lump sum consideration b further development of the concept and further filing of patent and all patent related applications before taking steps as outlined in a the process b will obviously increase the realization in terms of price b licencing options i new vehicles granting of licenses to manufacturers of automobiles individually or collectively all over the world for incorporation in the automobiles to be manufactured in future on fixed time or per piece basis ii conversion of existing vehicles to independent agents for conversion of the existing more than billion vehicles all over the world c combined options a collaborative arrangement with some private and or government agency wherein we receive a certain down payment and then jointly distribute the licensing rights on a pre decided sharing partnership arrangement the economics of the project will be as follows in case any all processes and systems described by us are incorporated in the design of new vehicles and the new vehicles are manufactured in accordance with the modified designs the cost escalation may not be more than to and the safety and the protection will be ten times more than the price escalation hence drop in insurance premier will compensate for the cost escalation in case the existing vehicles are modified the cost involved will be approximately to of the value of the vehicle but partial modifications at a lower cost which will give partial protection may also be carried out as a thumb rule the cost of modification in percentage terms will be about one fifth of the percentage of safety and protection provided in case the value of the vehicles is low or the life of the vehicle is about to expire the partial modifications may be practically and economically viable as incorporation onto a new vehicle is relatively less expensive and more protective there are more than billion motor vehicles in the world at present besides there are an unspecified number of non motorized ehicles almost all of them can be converted in phased manner to a variable degree the cost of conversion will be directly proportional to their current market value and the safety shield to be generated there from among the motorised vehicles the conversion cost may work out of few dollars for every percent of safety shield created the exact calculation can be worked out but over all some of the methods may provide more safety at lower cost compared to the other which may differ in efficiency even if we consider a very vague and approximate cost of conversion of us per vehicle the conversion industry works out to be worth billion us realising the potential of the product in terms of human safety it will be reasonable to presume that majority of such conversion will be completed over a period of three years from the starting date as pointed hereinabove the size of the conversion industry may be estimated to in the range of billion us per year over the next three years alternatively considering the diversity of available motorised vehicles all over the world conversion licensing can also be commercially viable proposition for such conversion licenses can be granted on line on receipt of on line payments in that case different rates for granting conversion to vehicles having specific registration numbers can be granted in accordance with and in proportion to the size carrying capacity and the engine power of the vehicle in case licensing is done the creation and installation of the concerned systems will be done by the end user as per his circumstances and needs however piracy is likely to be a major problem in such licensing it is likely that as and when the systems are introduced in the motorised vehicles unusual and unprecedented demand of new vehicles is created this will result in massive rejection of the vehicles currently playing all over the world and stimulate an entirely new market as far as motorised vehicle is concerned the size of such market is difficult to either comprehend and or estimate p s some of the figures have been rounded off but generally the figures are correct we have tried to keep this communication brief and to the point more details including website references are available with us and can be provided if required,1

shares wi skyrocket price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bull market in a generation natural gas prices have tripied in the last two years with multipie projects in high gear and the expanding production on reserves worth muiti miilions eogi is selling for less than the vaiue of its assets emerson oi and gas speciaiizes in using new technology to turn unproductive oi and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises already shares in the oi and gas sector are rising faster than the overa market in fact four of dow jones ten top performing industry sectors for the past year

dollar new markets and is expected to generate very significant recurring income with patented technology products to gain competitive advantage strategic partners are willing to integrate vspc s products on a worldwide basis future vspc cost effective growth is based on the fabless business model perfected by the semiconductor industry which for example outsources wafer manufacturing to the far east strong management team a strong management team is the most important critical ingredient to creating future shareholder value vspc has a strong management team see below large rapidly growing markets in general to increase shareholder value a company must participate in rapidly growing markets and should try to be a significant player in targeted markets vspc expects to dominate billion dollar markets that do not exist today by introducing believe it or not technology innovations that create and expand markets breakthrough products in the vspc pipeline vpsc products in the

total breakthrough with a nanotechnology based mass spectrometer is a portable carry on suitcase size device that processes identifies one molecule at a time further miniaturization is expected to shoebox size compared with stationary desk size provided by today s competitors significant recurring income from fuel cell batteries in five years annual revenue from disposable fuel cartridges for fuel cell powered portable electronic devices is expected to range between billion on the low side to billion on the high side that market does not exist today vspc s fuel cell cartridge business model is similar to the well known razor razor blade model which is to sell the razor and then make much more money on the recurring blade business the fuel cell is a razor and the disposable fuel cartridge is the razor blade another analogy is the flashlight battery model imagine if a company had the primary intellectual property involved in manufacturing flashlights it would probably license that technology to major flashlight manufacturers in return for help in dominating the recurring flashlight battery business in this case vspc has the proprietary rights to the flashlight the fuel cell and intends to sell the flashlight battery specifically disposable fuel cartridges for an end user price of each vspc is currently negotiating to provide its patented fuel cell technology to major computer manufacturers in return for their agreement to use disposable fuel cartridges developed by vspc the manufacturing of which will be outsourced to well known major plants in the far east intellectual property protected with patents vspc s fuel cell technology for example is protected by over issued and pending patents strategic partners lend credibility to create a cost effective worldwide footprint emerging companies must partner with branded global companies who have strong management teams and significant resources vspc is partnering with major well known market leaders who have management resources and global branding partners are attracted to vspc s technology and expect to gain competitive advantage by integrating patented proprietary technology obtained from vspc for example in the fuel cell business toshiba nec sanyo hitachi and samsung have unveiled prototype fuel cell powered products that more than double the operating time over existing battery technology

global relevance by leveraging unique expertise not available elsewhere in the commercial world viaspace sees a compelling business opportunity in the homeland security public safety and fuel cell markets viaspace target markets are in excess of b yr and growing with a cagr of over in the past six years viaspace has created three companies spectrasensors qwip technologies and vialogy corp their websites provide a background on the commercialization of nasa technology spectrasensors com qwip com vialogy com the company s current focus is on three subsidiaries direct methanol fuel cell arroyo sciences and ionfinity direct liquid methanol fuel cell direct methanol fuel cell corporation dmfcc will provide disposable methanol fuel cell cartridges for tomorrow s fuel cell powered portable electronic devices such as laptop computers and cell phones methanol fuel cells dfmc are expected to replace lithium ion batteries in portable electronic devices a dfmc can power a laptop for up to hours on a disposable cartridge that costs to a smaller cartridge can power a cell phone for up to weeks we believe consumers will spend a few extra dollars for the convenience of keeping their cell phones and other electronic devices operating as a disposable product it generates recurring revenue for dmfcc the technology is protected by over issued and pending patents toshiba nec sanyo and samsung have unveiled prototype fuel cell powered products that more than double the operating time over existing battery technology dmfcc has opened a tokyo office to work closely with japanese manufacturers arroyo sciences inc arroyo focuses on the fusion of radio frequency nuclear and electromagnetic imaging to deliver information products in transportation supply chain security logistics

clean up additional projects under review projects not included in our forecast are a water purification technology and interactive radio the water purification system displays impressive statistics in that it can convert brackish sewage or industrial wastewater into ultra pure water the water system is scalable from house to municipal usage and will last years while requiring minimal maintenance the interactive radio enables a listener to receive emails or web sites delivered in response to what is broadcast the radio station essentially receives input from listeners that could enhance advertising and improve vertical market focus forecasts and valuation we expect revenues for dmfcc will be driven by increasing wireless usage of computing devices and the existing need to extend cell phone battery life we expect revenues for dmfcc will commence in and grow to million by homeland security expenditures on airport and seaport security will be a primary revenue driver for arroyo sciences which will begin to generate revenues in and will grow to million in we expect commercial revenues for ionfinity will commence in late and will be million in beyond total revenues will grow at a to rate for several years from existing and new products contracting with existing manufacturers we expect operating margins will be in the low range by our initial forecasts indicate a fair

info you requested kcc thank you for your interest judgment coursesoffers an extensive training course in how to collect moneyjudgments if you are like many people you are not even sure what a money judgment is and why processing money judgments can earn you very substantial income if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you will have a money judgment against them you are happy you won but you will soon find out the shocking fact its now up to you to collect on the judgment the court does not require the loser to pay you the court will not even help you you must trace the loser down find their assets their employment bank accounts real estate stocks and bonds etc very few people know how to find these assets or what to do when they are found the result is that millions of judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten in of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a dime the non payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic proportions right now in the united states there is between and billion dollars of uncollectedmoney judgment debt for every judgment that is paid more judgments take its place we identified this massive market years ago and have actively pursued judicial judgments since we invented this business we have perfected it into a well proven and solid profession in which only a select few will be trained in the techniques necessary to succeed with our first hand experience we have built a course which teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown and exciting field of processing money judgments by following the steps laid out in our course and with reasonable effort you can become very successful in the processing of money judgments the income potential is substantial in this profession we have associates who have taken our course and are now working full time making to over per year part time associates are earning between and per year some choose to operateout of their home and work by themselves others build a sizable organization of to people in attractive business offices today our company and our associates have over million dollars in money judgments that we are currently processing of this million million is in the form of joint ventures between our firm and our associates joint ventures are where we make our money we only break even when our course is purchased we make a margin on the reports we supply to our associates our reporting capability is so extensive that government agencies police officers attorneys credit agencies etc all come to us for reports many of our associates already have real estate liens in force of between million to over million dollars legally this means that when the properties are sold or refinanced our associate must be paid off the norm is interest compounded annually on unpaid money judgments annual interest on million at translates to annually in interest income not counting the payment of the principal our associates earn half of this amount or per year this is just for interest not counting principle and not counting the compounding of the interest which can add substantial additional income typically companies are sold for times earnings just based on simple interest an associate with million in real estate liens could sell their business for approximately million dollars of all of our associates work out of their home are women and are part time one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are not under any kind of time frame if you decide to take off for a month on vacation then go the judgments you are working on will be there when you return the judgments are still in force they do not disappear the way we train you is non confrontational you use your computer and telephone to do most of the processing you never confront the debtor the debtor doesn t know who you are you are not a collection agency simply stated the steps to successful money processing are as follows mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals with money judgments we train you how to find out who to write to to of the firms and people you write will call you and ask for your help they call you you don t call them unless you want to you send them an agreement supplied in the course to sign which splits every dollar you collect to you and to them this applies no matter if the judgment is for or you then go on line to our computers to find the debtor and their assets we offer over powerful reports to assist you they range from credit reports from all three credit bureaus to bank account locates employment locates skip traces and locating stocks and bonds etc the prices of our reports are very low typically to of what other firms charge for example we charge for an individuals credit report when some other companies charge once you find the debtor and their assets you file garnishments and liens on the assets you have located standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the course when you receive the assets you keep and send to the original judgment holder once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of judgment to the court included in the course quote s from several of our students thomas in area code writes us i just wanted to drop you a short note thanking you for your excellent course my first week part time will net me dollars your professionalism in

read an article in the economist that highlighted online gaming and how it has become a socially acceptable form of entertainment over the next few days as we thought about what sort of impact this trend could have we started to notice that online gambling was being discussed all over the media in newspapers online and on television it became obvious to us that more and more people were jumping on the internet to bet on games we also came across some staggering statistics merrill lynch for example has predicted that gambling has the potential to account for a full of global economic activity

the online gaming industry in other words appears to be booming and it may be an ideal time to is time to invest we decided to find out who the key players were in the business after speaking with a number of industry insiders the trail led us to an emerging publicly traded company called gaming transactions inc ggts after a close look at ggts we decided that this company could produce huge returns on investment in the upcoming months although ggts is a new company it has some surprisingly experienced players at the helm an uncommon thing to find in an industry only ten years old the company has come out with online versions of the addictive game keno and its management team was smart enough to secure the rights to the keno com website which if youre marketing keno is as good as it gets keno has the widest spread for the house of any mainstream gambling game ggts is also about to launch a suite of other online gambling games including poker and sports book betting once it offers these popular games and given that it already has keno com online the company could bring in great revenues attracting a lot of attention in the investment community and driving up its stock price after a successful north american launch gaming transactions inc gtts has translated its games into chinese and is about to hit asia this initiative looks like a wise business decision many analysis anticipate that china will be the biggest source of online gambling revenue by so the company could be poised for massive expansion in terms of both profits and global reach what does all this tell us a brand new company a popular well known game one of the biggest spreads for the house a growing market experienced management and a stock price that is trading under a dollar it adds up
