this change went in for the deal validation group it gives them the ability to change counterparties names after bridge back impact to logistics unify if a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge backed it could cause problems on edi pipes as that new counterparty name will flow over to unify and repathing should eventually take place one problem may be with the imbalance data sets which are not in production yet edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities especially where nominations were sent for entire month can t remember the rules on this one but i think unify does have some safe guards idiot proofs to force re pathing unify does have the ability to over ride duns numbers yet would still cause an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order to get a clean quick response what are if any impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take place prior periods re pathing i have a call into diane and dave both after speaking w them hopefully i can get a clear understanding of the true impact i am sure we ll need to put some processes and procedures

sitara release re changes in global due to consent to assignment regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in sitara with confirmed volumes tom s words of caution if someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty we created the ability for you to invalidate the deal and then change the counterparty however i did add a warning message warning changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes make sure pipeline allows this change some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is feedback i assume for the same reasons we had this rule it used to blow up our old scheduling systems pre unify some pipelines will require a new deal and we will have to zero out the old deal before you make the change make sure the logistics person is aware just in case it causes problems with their pipeline sorry i don t know which pipes these are you will have to ask the unify team there is one rule still in place you can change from ena im east to ena im market east but not from ena im texas to hplc im hplc when changing business units they must be the same legal entity warning not the same legal entity also beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals transport capacity storage cash out once the deal is invalidated there are no rules don t forget the items were locked down for a reason if you invalidate a service deal and change the previously locked down data that was validated and someone used these deals in unify it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created using these deals will get corrupted always check with someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in unify forwarded by thomas engel hou ect on am from scott mills on pm to kathryn cordes hou ect ect dana daigle corp enron

concerned that ypf will anticipatorily cancel the gsa but t would seem to be an invitation to them to do that also do we really want the banks to say it is not fruitful to proceed with the consent would it be better for the banks simply to stick to their guns re the consent decline all of ypf s suggested changes and insist on their version of december that way ypf could be portrayed as partly to blame for failure to achieve a financial close by may it might help deflect the argument that we had control over all of the c p s and rigged it to get out of the gsa what do you think richard a

eddy daniels enron com subject ypf consent a quick update in regards to doris rodriguez s letter regarding the ypf consent i have left a message for david schumacher asking that he call me to doris s letter given the current status of things it would seem to me that there is no value in proceeding with the consent on the other hand we need to continue to build our case in the event of an arbitration with ypf it would seem to me that the best thing would be for the lenders to tell doris that the lenders understanding is that under the current project schedule the conditions precedent under the ypf gsa cannot be satisfied and that enron and ypf have had some discussions regarding this issue and will continue to discuss the issue until the ypf gsa is restructured in some form there is little value in proceeding on the consent especially given that ypf and the lenders are still so far apart on the consent the status of the ypf consent is as follows doris sent a revised draft of the consent to the lenders in august the lenders responded with comments which included several of my comments in october doris then responded with a counter draft in december doris latest draft again had numerous significant comments which i have not thoroughly reviewed a quick review however indicates that doris has cut in half many of the time periods for the lenders to cure scg defaults in addition doris has restructured several provisions in order to make certain ypf commitments run in favor of scg only and not the lenders which may be of no value to the lenders in a situation in which the lenders have to step into scg s shoes i am confident that the lenders will not accept doris s comments since many are proposals the lenders have rejected before let me know whether i should suggest to dave schumacher a response to doris along the lines i recommend regards dean confidentiality notice the information in this email may be confidential and or privileged this email is

hou ect ect subject re christi this is generating a lot of interest elizabeth sager has been working on the eei contract for enron betsy carr bcarr bracepatt com on pm to christi l nicolay hou ect ect cc subject christi this is generating a lot of interest christi this is generating a lot of interest by mark golden  a dow jones newswires column  new york dow jones et tu sonnet  the edison electric institute unveiled wednesday a standardized master agreement for trading power but there s already a standard contract the one written by the western systems power pool  there are several ways to characterize this battle east versus west power marketers versus utilities and even southern co versus southern co a power struggle has begun despite the fact that most traders preschedulers and trading managers aren t even aware of the new contract  southern co so vice president bobby campo has been a leader in wspp since the organization s inception and has been chairman of its contract committee for four years yet southern co energy marketing s chief counsel sonnet edmonds is a leader in the rival contract faction  will eei along with its comrade the national energy marketers association manage to dethrone the wspp contract or crash wspp s raison d etre is to manage and promote use of its contract which is traded extensively in the west and has gained proponents in the east  i m not real excited about it right now campo said of the new contract the eei contract is being done by contract people and lawyers we operators and power marketers worked on our contract for years before we brought in the lawyers it the new contract may die from a lack of interest from participants but eei has the ability to keep it alive  it isn t clear if the big power marketing companies will get the ball rolling by asking counterparties to switch to the eei contract edmonds hopes that southern co will do so  management hasn t given the official word yet but we participated in its development so i imagine we ll use it at some point she said  enron corp s ene general counsel also worked on the eei contract but the company hasn t made a decision to actually use it  entergy corp s etr general counsel christopher bernard led the effort to develop the new contract as head of nem s standardized contract committee but entergy s jim kenney is chairman of wspp s executive committee entergy s power trading managers meanwhile haven t even read the new contract yet  duke power co duk an nem member is looking at it a spokesman said enron and southern co aren t nem members though they serve on its contract committee  several sources said american electric power aep has agreed to be the guinea pig and plans to switch to the eei contract with counterparties on eastern u s trades a spokesman for the utility couldn t confirm or deny that rumor because paul addis president of aep energy services has imposed a vow of silence on aep s traders  there are elements of the eei contract that power marketers may like one innovation is a new product called firm no force majeure which requires the payment of liquidated damages for failure to deliver no excuses no force majeure just send a check  the new contract also has two other firm products firm liquidated damages is closest to the wspp firm product but it defines force majeure more strictly than wspp firm ld system reliability explicitly allows a selling utility to curtail deliveries without paying liquidated damages if necessary to maintain native load of particular interest to traders of eastern u s electricity is the fact that the eei contract defines what an into product is  wspp has debated the introduction of such products but in the end has tried to come up with a single agreed upon product for trading  eei has created a lot of different types of firm products but that can create problems many people have said no we want one firm product said wspp s counsel michael small of washington d c law firm wright and talisman  so why didn t the eei group just work with wspp to get changes made to the existing standard too much bureaucracy according to southern s edmonds  changes to the wspp contract require approval from of the members after working through the operations committee and the executive committee then the changes have to be filed at federal energy regulatory commission edmonds said  coincidentally wspp s executive committee is meeting friday in san diego to discuss what changes are needed in the definition of its firm product western utilities are pushing hard for firm to mean backed up by reserves of generating assets or previously purchased power in other words some utilities want to eliminate short positions from power markets  at least one power marketing company which didn t want to be named will switch to the eei contract if that change gets made to wspp  for the eei contract to fly not only will the lawyers at the big trading companies need to make it their companies standard but traders will have to convince utilities to abandon most if not all force majeure claims many municipal utilities and rural electric cooperatives are forbidden to do so by state regulations  for traders though the biggest adjustment to make if the eei contract does take off will be more social than professional the semi annual meeting of the wspp s operations committee is as much fun as any blatant boondoggle should be the serious work of a handful of committee members is a small hook on which hangs the revelry of hundreds of power marketers brokers and utility staffers as it stands non committee members must have a hard time convincing bosses that their presence is necessary at the meeting  how on earth will traders justify going if the wspp contract is no longer used can eei throw a good party and how will the gucci loafered eei executives from washington handle dares to go naked in a bar  such are the questions now vexing america s electric utilities  by mark golden dow jones newswires mark golden dowjones com  copyright c dow jones company inc,0

critical path items checklist on the sub debt that john barquin and i are going to discuss with john novak tomorrow at a m after we work through it i would be glad to forward it to you in short and in answer to your specific question as advised by machado meyer i think that we will either be reissuing new promissory notes for all of the sub debt with new maturity dates or entering into loan agreements between epe and gasmat as borrowers and then the respective enron and shell lenders to extend the maturity date to december as the note from celso below explains then we will just deliver request for extension letters to the central bank to request them to amend the registrations to reflect the new maturity date this should all be done before the existing loans mature on december

until june original message from beckworth melissa sent tuesday november pm to novak john enron barquin john cc miguel mendoza enron com subject fw cuiaba sub debt importance high john john we have a new sub debt issue the existing shareholder subordinated loan promissory notes have a maturity of the earlier of december or the closing of third party financing and the central bank registrations reflect that celso has requested mmso to draft letters to the central bank asking for an extension of the maturity to june he says that johannes walzebuck has agreed to the extension of maturity for shell but that he has had no response from enron i think he sent a message to novak powell lammers rangel walzebuck and dutton on nov the a r sfa doesn t have an explicit maturity date for the loans but it has a form of note attached which carries the maturity date the notes are to be considered a part of the agreement the form of note attached to the a r sfa carries default interest but the simple form notes that are actually in existence the ones that were just printed do not have default interest provisions we had to match the original registrations and default interest was not a registered payment condition unless you all want to just leave the notes and hope that we can collect default interest i have asked mmso what we need to do i assume we have to issue replacement promissory notes with the new maturity date we would then send the notification letters to the central bank notifying them of the extension we also need to address this in the nd a to the a r sfa my note below tries to explain what all is going on with the various assignments and notifications the main thing i need from you is to let me know what your thoughts are from an enron perspective and

not been able to speak with you about this i do not recall receiving a message from you about this previously and i have been out of the office without access to my e mail or international service all day today the amended and restated shareholders funding agreement will have to be amended there is a nd amendment in draft form right now that has not been finalized to include a new form of note with the new maturity date we will also have to draft some form of letter agreement waiver to address the fact that the maturity of the previously issued promissory notes is being extended perhaps this can just be an additional provision in the nd amendment fabio and irenne will we need to issue replacement promissory notes with the new maturity date for all of the existing promissory notes or is there any other way to address this effectively under brazilian law also fabio and irenne with respect to the notification letters for the tr buyout loans i wonder if it might be easier to go ahead and deliver the notices of assignment to the central bank because the loans that were assigned and the loans mentioned in the letters do not encompass all of the shareholder loans the shell assignment agreement for the sgl to schl assignment for epe should be complete within the next few days and is dated as of september i assume shell has notification letters to deliver as well for that assignment did you receive my fax with the mark up of the notification letters maybe we could do this in two steps deliver the notification of assignment letters and schedules for the transredes buyout and for the shell assignment of epe loans from sgl to stdcl execute nd amendment to a r shareholders funding agreement with new form of promissory note with new maturity and approving extension of maturity date of existing loans complete the enron assignments of the replacement notes for epe and gasmat credits to enron netherlands holdings b v and notify the central bank of the extension of the maturity date on the existing promissory notes and of the enron assignments the reason i suggest this breakdown is that the items in number are basically complete and have been approved the others are not complete yet and could be done in the next week or two i know this is a lot to coordinate you can let me know if you have suggestions about the different steps we should take and in what order i will

irene has told me that the change in the dates of the certificates is due to the fact that the loans that are going to be used to repay the amounts reflected in the certificates are not going to be granted this year but only mid next year therefore the current date would be changed to june th celso i would like to ask you to kindly confirm this understanding since irene has told me that you asked her to make the letters to the central bank notifying the date change but she had not had more details about the matter finally melissa has asked machado meyer whether the current drafts of the

i think it looks good a few suggestions though i haven t read the whole reprt so i can t say for sure that it alleges no price gouging make sure to forward this to jeff my e mail is slow on the road we can say though that instead of blaming generators and marketers the report blames the structure of the market for california s woes i think we should shorten the quote to something like the reprt is consistent with what we have said all along we should say that the scheduling penalties part of the order will penalize utilities for underscheduling not predicting hedging is not about holding pirces down so much as it is about protecting people from wild price swings that s what allowing utilities to buy outside the spot should help do also my title is just evp and chief of staff jmandelker aol com pm to skean enron com jeff dasovich enron com cc subject approval of ferc article for ebiz thanks for talking to me about this article for this friday s ebiz please read it over and let me have comments tomorrow morning thursday it goes live p m thursday evening sorry for aol my notes is wreaking havoc today jeff steve confirmed that the report said power sellers did not exercise market power or price gouging so i put it in the article take care jeannie ferc report doc,0

thanks for the commnets lynn i ve faxed you a copy of plan b i ll let others chime in but ideally it seemsthat we d want to start the meetings next week and have at least the rough outline of a proposed comprehensive solution to put on the table for discussion but at a minimum we d want to get the process nailed down by very early next week best jeff lynn a lednicky dynegy com am to jeff

edmonds mirant com randy harrison mirant com alex goldberg williams com maureen mcvicker enron com subject re summary of today s call agenda for tomorrow s call jeff sorry i was unable to make the call yesterday thanks for the summary my comments and questions are indicated below please fax a copy of plan b to be at you suggest starting the process in sacramento next week i m not sure exactly what this means are we saying we will have a proposal or that we will be advocating a process forum to get all the right parties at the table did we set a time for the next call on friday with regard to the issues list here are a few extra items need to make clear that real price signals should be sent to all sectors not just those that wouldn t vote for davis anyway as soon as possible i cannot imagine a situation in which the ious are returned to financial stability within months my guess is that it will be at least a year if ious are returned to the procurement role we need to make sure that they have the appropriate risk management tools ability to enter forward contracts options etc if ious are returned to the procurement role we also need to have assurances that the situation we have today won t happen again for example if the state assigns the cdwr contracts to the ious and three years from now the market price is less than the contract price what assurances does anyone have that the puc will not try to make the ious absorb the difference if we want to go to a core non core approach why do we need to wait months it seems to me that we could start that process now as for legal claims and investigations we need to make clear that we want to resolve all state and federal claims the civil claims present a different set of challenges for resolution as for discounts on receivables i m not ready to commit one way or another however if there are discounts they must apply to all market participants not just the ones that davis can get to the table lynn jeff dasovich

order to keep everyone in the loop the folks on today s call wanted to send out a brief summary of the call for the benefit of those who couldn t make it apologies for any omissions inaccuracies etc others who were on the call please chime in if i ve gotten anything wrong or missed anything best jeff summary enron duke el paso and williams were on the call as was michael hoffman of the blackstone group the governor s financial advisors on the subject of how the group would organize itself it was agreed that the calls would be open to anyone who wanted to participate a smaller group consisting of duke el paso enron and williams would take the lead on walking the halls of sacramento meeting with policy makers and advocating whatever plan the group develops folks agreed that achieving a comprehesive solution requires a tangible process that is the principals need to get in a room face to face for however long it takes to work out a resolution it was agreed that the process should start no later than the beginning of next week and that it should take place in sacramento it was decided that the legislature and the attorney general needed to be brought into the process as soon as possible i e next week there was some discussion regarding the release today of plan b plan b is a plan proposed by democratic and republican legislators as an alternative to the mou that the governor struck with edison after that call i received a copy of plan b if you d like a copy please send me your fax number folks on the call agreed to have the next supplier only call in meeting on friday finally michael hoffman said that they are hoping to have a ratings agency level presentation prepared by the end of the week the goal of the presentation is to reassure capital markets that the bonds the state seeks to issue are solidly backed by retail rates the agenda for tomorrow s call with the governor s staff item the credit issue michael hoffman said that the governor s office wants to start tomorrow s meeting discussing the creditworthiness issue hoffman said that the governor s folks are hoping to have completed by the start of tomorrow s meeting a draft of an agreement between the california puc and cdwr the agreement is designed to ensure that dwr gets paid for power services delivered if the draft is ready they d like to discuss on the call tomorrow item identify the components of a comprehensive solution it was agreed that our group should put on the table at tomorrow s meeting the universe of issues that need to be included in a comprehensive solution enron was asked to take a first stab at what those components are the following is a brief outline which is not intended to be definitive but a starting point for discussion utility creditworthiness retail rates must reflect costs increase supply streamline and otherwise reform the siting process decrease demand establish real time pricing implement demand buy down and other conservation programs create a real market remove the state from the power buying business as soon as possible e g once new rates are in place and utilities are returned to creditworthiness approximately months return the procurement role to the utilities reinstate direct access immediately for all customers within months create a core noncore market structure for electricity similar to california s market structure for natural gas keep the industry in the hands of the private sector reject proposals calling on the state to take over transmission generation etc resolve outstanding legal claims investigations etc resolution requires certainty and prompt payment understanding that discounts on receivables is on the table for discussion,0

guys i received harrell s memo concerning the fuel use for the turbine and the fact that you had to reduce gas producer speeds to comply with the permits fuel use requirements my question is how does the fuel use compare with what solar says the fuel use should be if we can get solar to provide written guarantees and up the fuel use value for the turbine we can up the fuel value on the permit the state of colorado perceives increased fuel use beyond manufacturers values as the turbine not operating correctly and in need of mechanical adjustment from their eyes this would be a strong indication of excess emissions and i think there evaluation would hold some merit anyway i dont want to send up a red flag to the state of colorado would you contact solar and compare their fuel use values with what the monitors say the turbine is burning at la plata then let me know if worse gets to worse i may be able to use another tactic but only as a last resort,0

a much better note in bottle thrown out to sea i didn t actually write all this mushy stuff someone sent it to me it hurts to love someone and not be loved in return but what is more painful is to love someone and never find the courage to let that person know how you feel maybe god wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one so that when we finally meet the right person we will know how to begrateful for that gift love is when you take away the feeling the passion and the romance in a relationship and find out you still care for that person  a sad thing in life is when you meet someone who means a lot to you only to find out in the end that it was never meant to be and you just have to let go the best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch and swing with never say a word and then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you ve ever had it s true the we don t know what we ve got until we lose it but it s also true that we don t know what we ve been missing until it arrives  giving someone all your love is never assurance that they ll love you back don t expect love in return just wait for it to grow in their heart but if it doesn t be content it grew in yours there are things you d love to hear that you would never hear from the person whom you would like to hear them from but don t be so deaf as not to hear it from the one who says it from his heart  never say good bye if you still want to try never give up if you still feel you can go on never say you don t love a person anymore if you can t let go love comes to those who still hope although they ve been disappointed there are moments in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from your dreams and hug them for real hope you dream of that special someone dream what you want to dream go where you want to go be what you want to be because you have only one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do  always put yourself in others shoes if you feel that it hurts you it probably hurts the person too a careless word may kindle strife a cruel word may wreck a life a timely word may level stress a loving word may heal and bless  the happiest of people don t necessarily have the best of everything they just make the most of everything that comes along their way happiness lies for those who cry those who hurt those who have searched and those who have tried for only they can appreciate the importance of people who have touched their lives love begins with a smile grows with a kiss and ends with a tear the brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past you can t go on well in life until you let go of your past failures and heartaches when you were born you were crying and everyone around you was smiling live your life so that when you die you re the one who is smiling and everyone around you is crying,0

match financial times jun am  words by hillary durgin  if jeffrey skilling is right  enron s acquisition of mg is only the tip of the iceberg enron s president and chief operating officer is engineering a fundamental strategy shift at the houston energy company aimed at making it a dominant new economy player across various industrial markets  the dollars m acquisition last month of mg the uk based metals trader is only the first of more than dollars bn in estimated new investments the company is targeting it is seeking vehicles on which to build business to business b b platforms in sectors such as logistics chemicals agricultural products and pulp paper  mr skilling wants to take the business model the company developed in natural gas and power and apply it to other wholesale commodity markets he argues the electronic platforms it creates will not only become the principal b b sites for those sectors but reshape those industries  as an example he points to enron s new e commerce platform enrononline which has changed the way the company does business with its customers while significantly increasing sales  the company the largest wholesale merchant of natural gas and power saw wholesale physical deliveries of natural gas surge per cent in the first quarter  critics argue that enron s move away from its familiar energy business into new industries where the learning curve is steep and the competition entrenched is risky yet a number of industry analysts point out enron has proved it understands markets and how to manage risks while becoming the largest importer of coal in the uk the largest trader of gas and power in the us and grabbing an advantage in bandwidth  it s a prudent strategy but it s got to be done in an orderly way says ronald barone analyst with paine webber in new york what they re doing here is what they ve been incredibly successful at doing he adds noting that enron posted dollars bn in earnings before interest and taxes ebit

consulting group  that edison has long used on gas issues in california gave last week to t he legislative committee investigating wholesale gas prices at the california  border the day following this presentation which was followed by a presentation by the california puc s ferc lawyer the committee called el  paso and dynegy to respond to brattle s and the cpuc ferc lawyer s presentations also attached is the best synopsis of the hearing that i ve  seen in the press best jeff    competing evidence clouds calif investigation prompted in part by the california public utilities commission the california assembly has been scrutinizing the role that interstate pipelines have played in the  state s current energy crisis in the efforts to find a smoking gun legislators have leane d heavily on a report prepared by the brattle group a consultancy commissioned by utility  southern california edison to dig up evidence of market power abuse but the state s biggest transporter of gas to california el paso natu ral gas is not ready to take the rap the pipeline has commissioned its own study which i t recently presented as evidence that it has not circumvented any laws or regulation as reported in both the trade press and national media socal ed and the cp uc are pointing the finger of blame at el paso for alleged manipulation of california borde r prices through affiliate deals and capacity hoarding and exhibit a in their case against el paso is the brattle group s study of the california market richard zeiger a spokesman for assembly member darrell steinberg chairman  of the california assembly judiciary committee told gas daily that the brattle group s market study proved that the surge in gas prices at the california border was not  caused by normal market forces gd his remarks followed an oversight hearing during  which assembly members questioned dynegy and el paso officials about their involvement in  the california market el paso presented a different version of events to the assembly in a repor t presented to legislators a research group hired by el paso concluded that a convergence  of factors not a conspiracy caused the price run up lukens consulting group a houston based consultancy was retained by el pa so to conduct work on several fronts in its study of the california market lukens concluded that the increasing convergence of the gas and electricity businesses was one of the  main culprits in the california gas price imbroglio assemblyman john campbell a republican member of the oversight committee  said he didn t see any smoking gun in either report we had our committee hearing and we certainly had a lot on the brattle study and a little on the lukens study to some degree i m not sure that the california legislature is the best place to adjudicate the differences between these two studies campbell said i believe ferc is looking at this situation and it would seem to me that that s the  appropriate place campbell said that the cpuc had been prodding the california legislature to  give support to its claims of market power abuse by pipelines it s being pushed basically by the public utilities commission here which believes that there was collusion by pipeline companies to push up gas prices in california he said the cpuc campbell suggested sought satisfaction before the california assembly when it had failed on the federal level there s a concerted effort not jus t on natural gas but on other things here in california for entities and organizations here to point the  finger elsewhere for the problems that we re having in this state and i think you re seein g some of that with the public utilities commission whether either report wins over the public incensed by high natural gas prices is a different matter entirely in the meanwhile the dueling california market studies se em to have taken on a life of their own the brattle group study for instance has become the center of a heavily  litigated effort to force ferc to compel the release of market data by california market participants following on a request by socal ed which said it needed additional data to round out  the brattle group report ferc chief alj curtis wagner issued subpoenas to the other three major pipelines that serve the state as well as to sempra energy trading several parties resisted ferc s call for market information saying the  requested data contained commercially sensitive information ferc allowed the discovery process to move forward but only after attaching strict data protection rules restricting  access to evidence gd critics of the pipeline industry have already suffered one setback in their  case the commission recently dismissed the cpuc s claim that el paso rigged the auction of a  large block of pipeline capacity in favor of affiliate el paso merchant energy in addressing the california assembly representatives of dynegy said that ferc s recent ruling on th e california border controversy obviated the need for more investigation the controversy however is far from over ferc last month also ordered a  hearing into whether el paso natural gas and its affiliates manipulated capacity to driv e up the price of gas delivered into california gd that hearing is likely to take place  this summer rp et al nh forwarded by jeff dasovich na enron on pm douglas porter sce com am  to jeff dasovich enron com

not sure if you guys saw this pl muse bowden panicked after lowder told him his job in jeopardy the associated press  montgomery ala ap when auburn s football fortunes took a turn for the worse in trustee bobby lowder told coach terry bowden that he would not be retained after the season former university president william muse said when bowden resigned on the eve of a game that fall he said he was essentially fired basically mr lowder told him he would not be around come the end of the season and coach bowden basically in my opinion panicked when he was told that and came and negotiated out of his contract muse said more auburn football talkin tigers forum muse said lowder did not consult with him before speaking to bowden whose team was off to a start bowden said thursday that lowder actually did not speak directly to him but went through athletic director david housel that s how david and i worked bowden said tuesday in a telephone interview from his orlando home we would meet and he would tell me what lowder wanted me to do i felt like i could do everything i could do and it wouldn t be enough to save his job muse made his comments to faculty members march a transcript of the meeting was made public tuesday by auburn officials muse said he was unable to reach bowden until the wee hours of the morning then told him that lowder didn t have the authority to fire him and urged him to stay until the end of the season muse said that was the most celebrated case of lowder taking such a direct role in athletic decisions but there are many others bowden often commented that mr lowder hired me and that the coach had regular contact with the powerful trustee muse said bowden said he spoke with lowder weekly if not daily during his first two or three seasons but never felt it was a situation that he would tell me something and that i should do it muse said lowder did not hand pick the coach he said an eight member search committee including lowder voted unanimously to offer bowden the job in  let s just say i would not have been hired if bobby lowder had not wanted me hired said bowden now a television commentator with abc there s no doubt about it bobby lowder controlled the committee that hired me at auburn both lowder and housel have denied bowden s contention that he was told his coaching fate was all but sealed they also denied that lowder was pulling the strings on that decision bowden always believed that the only way he got that job was because of lowder s influence muse said so he believed very strongly that he had to maintain that relationship muse said that relationship began to sour when bowden fired longtime defensive coordinator wayne hall muse also said he is not sure what lowder s relationship is with bowden s successor tommy tuberville but that he believes basketball coach cliff ellis has very very frequent contact with the montgomery banker lowder was out of town and did not immediately return a call for comment earlier tuesday he said in a statement issued by auburn that the trustees athletic panel he chairs will continue to provide support and input to the president and athletic director and that it s time to focus on positive accomplishments and stop bickering,0

steve thanks a lot i think that having the pseudo code will go a long way towards understanding how the system works and making sure that there are no bugs in translation of a business problem for example complicated credit insurance deals with multiple triggers and conditionality into the code regarding tanya s attitude just a few points i don t think she has the skills to do the system administrator s work and she does not have the necessary privileges this explains why she keeps asking winston for help it s not that the work is beneath her some members of tanya s team came to me complaining about winston he effectively told them to go away and work on the research projects and that he would take care of the it issues i don t think that it s just tanya s issue though i agree that a more outgoing personality would be helpful the reality of this situation is that the internal customers beat on tanya and me whenever there is any performance problems and or they intuitively disagree with the results of a run they could not care less about the demarcation line between it and research they also want tanya to sign off on the model and she cannot do it without full access to the code the bottom line is that we are in full agreement tanya and winston have to work as a team and i shall work on my end to make sure that it happens credit is emerging as a critical issue for enron for the next few weeks and the system cannot fail vince from stephen stock enron enronxgate on am to vince j kaminski hou ect ect cc subject progress vince i got feedback from the lunchtime research meeting that you were talking about some specific solutions to performance of it systems in particular distributed processing also i heard that you had concerns about the use of multiple languages etc both of these sound like what i was discussing with you on previous occasions do you feel the need to discuss these further the multi language issue isn t really that much of an issue as the current system is java right now although i am a big fan of c c it is my main development skill i am also very aware that java is a much more evolved and robust language i had serious doubts about the performance but i ve had a review conducted and the results are showing the sun unix implementation to be nearly as fast and in some cases faster than c c because of something they call hot spot technology its an instruction caching technique i believe the concerns i expressed to you were really about how technical people justify the use of a language on the strength of a relatively meaningless metric like portability on the issue of distributed processing the original review i had conducted by our architecture group pointed to that as a solution and as zhiyong wei is already working on global valuation project winston is actively working with zhiyong to see if he can model the var architecture on that and also to find a common valuation piece between the systems i d like the opportunity to talk to you about these issues if you have some time over the next few days also i sat in on the tanya winston meeting yesterday and as per our discussion at the elevator i attempted to help her argument by suggesting to all present that she was trying to perform triage on the code i e seperating research domain problems from it problems she said that stepping through code was the only real way in which she could get a feel for where performance bottlenecks were i asked her how she would measure that and she said she would instrument the code manually by inserting timing elements at strategic points i mentioned that a profiling tool could probably do this job for her tanya again said that stepping through code is the only way she can get an idea of the code and that studying documentation wasn t enough about weeks ago i commissioned a team to document the system down to psuedo code level and will be able to provide this to you and your team soon in fact i ve asked for a draft copy to be given to tanya right now and winston is also working on a draft research it working together document which will identify how the exchange of information takes place tanya also gave the impression that she wants a dedicated it developer to do all the environment setup for her because she doesn t really want to have to do that i think that this is probably the root cause of the issue the it guys are working very hard and her handling of the situation is not good as it gives the impression that this kind of work is beneath her she is claiming that they are un cooperative they are claiming that she continually asks the same questions about set up over and over again and doesn t seem to want to learn how to do it winston on the other hand could be more proactive in determining what is a business related model issue and an it issue and ask for help from research i think you debbie and i need to work quite hard to get them to play nicely i have asked tanya and winston to go ahead and work very closely together over the next few days and debbie brackett and i will review their progress on friday in the meantime l ll be looking at setting up a working test environment that doesn t involve my main quant guys in day to to day setup issues as a longer term solution regards steve,0

per my conversations with tom and frank unless credit specifically tells us that a counterparty is a credit derivatives counterparty the online team should consider that all u s based counterparties are not approved to trade credit derivatives credit will in the same box where they put declined amended or division put a note that says credit derivatives and in those circumstances only you should consider that i will be indicating whether or not the counterparty is approved to trade credit derivatives otherwise i will not be putting an x in the box for each and every counterparty to say they can t trade credit derivatives i hope this makes sense to you call me if it doesn t,0

april interested in subscribing to the forecast  ucla forecasters see national recession as inevitable in california will not be immune with bay area very susceptible  los angeles economists with the ucla anderson business forecast see even more clear indicators of a recession for the nation in and project a percent chance that the nation s longest economic expansion will come to an end no later than the first quarter of the year is a transition year that will take the u s economy from the internet rush of to a lower level of sustainable economic growth in said edward leamer ucla anderson business forecast director and anderson school professor however getting from here to there will involve some painful adjustments he warns and monetary medicine from the fed won t stop the pain this time according to the econometric model used by ucla s forecasters the probability of a recession has increased nearly percent since december just three months ago dr leamer s forewarning of a recession was the most pessimistic and as it turns out the most accurate forecast made that quarter the expansion of was driven by new economy investment opportunities firms rushed pell mell to be the first kid on the block to have a cool website fear was a big motivator internet firms feared losing first mover advantage bricks and mortar firms feared they would lose out to pure internet business models almost every enterprise in the u s invested heavily in it equipment and software and hired the associated personnel said dr leamer things are different now the national recession and slowdown in investment in information technology and software has different implications for the principal regions of california a recession is quite likely for the bay area while southern california will experience many economic stresses though skirting an outright recession dr tom lieser author of the california forecast expects to see a high tech recession in california that will have a disproportionate impact on the san francisco bay area we will most likely see not only a slowing of demand for electronics communications equipment and related products but also a weeding out of the less well capitalized firms in these industries said dr lieser the ucla economist also expects a weak expansion in employment through with a corresponding rise in unemployment rates a substantial slowdown in the california service sector a mainstay of the state s economic growth is also quite likely the strong increase in residential building permits seen during the november january period will likely be short lived said dr lieser we expect to see declining home prices in the bay area this year southern california will also experience slower home sales and a lower rate of price increases higher energy prices the economists argue may pose a greater problem for other states than for california because of the state s lower per capita consumption on a per capita basis california ranked th out of in electricity consumption and th in natural gas consumption both in even with the state s notorious dependence on the automobile it still ranks only th out of the reporting states in per capita gasoline consumption and while the recent brownouts and blackouts may not perceptibly affect california incomes and employment in the short term a prolonged electricity crisis could discourage business expansion significantly in the longer run the ucla anderson business forecast is the most widely followed and often cited forecast for the state of california and was unique in predicting both the seriousness of the early s downturn in california and southern california and the strength of the state economy s rebound since  the forecast was presented at an all day conference at korn convocation hall at the anderson school at ucla in addition to providing the outlook for the state and national economy the conference examined the economic impact of california s energy crisis through a series of panels led by some of the nation s most prominent authorities speakers included loretta lynch president of the california public utilities commission mark bernstein senior policy analyst at rand corporation barry sedlik manager economic and business development southern california edison and joseph m otting executive vice president union bank of california,0

roseann gray barbara cc subject wonder if its off the balance sheet duke energy environmentalists strike deal over california plant tom knudson may knight ridder tribune business news krtbn copyright c krtbn knight ridder tribune business news source world reporter tm days after state regulators gave duke energy the go ahead to expand its moss landing power plant near monterey bay last fall documents show four environmental groups made their own deal with the utility giant the four signed an agreement not to participate in any lawsuit or regulatory challenge that might slow or stop the project in exchange for a financial concession million from duke for environmental monitoring and research balancing power generation and environmental protection always has been difficult but today as power starved california scrambles to find and permit new energy sources some fear the moss landing agreement shows that money can sway even environmentalists and tip the scales too far in favor of economic development environmentalists who signed the agreement though said that despite their concerns about the plant expansion they had little chance of stopping it especially after it was approved by the california energy commission and central coast regional water quality control board so they took the potentially controversial step entering into an agreement with duke for financial resources to pay for studies of the plant s impact on the marine environment other environmentalists though criticized that approach duke energy s efforts to modernize the moss landing power plant resulted in mitigation payments to environmental and other groups including million to the elkhorn slough foundation to mitigate the plant s use of seawater to the monterey bay sanctuary foundation over three years to monitor heated seawater discharge in the ocean million to the monterey bay sanctuary foundation over five years to monitor water quality through a program sponsored by save our shores the center for marine conservation the friends of the sea otter and the otter project to the marine mammal center to relocate its triage center for injured animals onto power plant property million to the moss landing chamber of commerce over years for infrastructure improvements in the moss landing community to design and construct a boardwalk for additional beach access in moss landing for an environmental assessment for a proposed elkhorn slough circle trail if approved duke would provide an additional endowment to maintain the trail it is very disheartening said carolyn nielson a retired teacher who along with some other local residents is waging a battle against what they consider an environmentally harmful power plant cooling system these environmental groups have the expertise the biologists the attorneys said nielson who has taken her case to the state water resources control board we could have been much more successful with their help but there wouldn t have been any financial reward in it for them such criticisms are off base according to warner chabot regional director for the center for marine conservation a national environmental group that was among those to sign the deal he said environmentalists got the best deal possible in the current energy climate look at what s happening with power plant approvals in california right now said chabot referring to the state s push to bring new energy sources on line the moss landing project which is scheduled to add megawatts in enough to serve one million homes is a key part of that energy expansion plan no money will go to the four environmental groups the center for marine conservation along with save our shores friends of the sea otter and the otter project it will be routed in five yearly installments of each to the monterey bay sanctuary foundation a nonprofit organization that helps support sanctuary programs including scientific research chabot helped found the sanctuary foundation and sits on its board he said the money will be used to monitor the health of elkhorn slough a biologically rich estuary that borders the plant and is linked to monterey bay not a dime comes to the center for marine conservation he said not a penny comes to me duke representatives said the controversy about the arrangement has been stirred by a handful of people it s a million dollars worth of water quality studies said duke spokesman tom williams our whole effort wasn t to try to buy anybody off it was designed to help increase people s comfort level where there wasn t a comfort level the million agreement signed in november is part of a package of more than million in duke payments to civil government and environmental groups in connection with the plant modernization the heftiest award million to the elkhorn slough foundation a nonprofit environmental organization was negotiated by state agencies to mitigate environmental impacts of the plant formed in the slough foundation exists to promote the wise use and conservation of elkhorn slough and surrounding wetlands its web site says however some environmentalists say the state approved mitigation plan is inadequate if you want to say who did duke roll with a big chunk of money i would say they rolled the california energy commission and the regional water board for the price of mitigation chabot said the agencies got bought off cheap and the environment got taken to the cleaners duke s williams strongly disagreed environmental mitigation must be based on science not on buying anybody off he said that is inappropriate and we would not participate in that that suggestion is offensive to us and it should be offensive to any environmentalist bob haussler head of the energy commission s environmental protection office said the mitigation plan is biologically sound we are confident it will improve the slough ecosystem he said madeline clark a local businesswoman and founder of monterey parkway a citizens group that scrutinizes local public works projects called the recipients of duke s payments a shopping list of government agencies environmental groups and civic organizations she was particularly critical of the million deal with environmental groups you know what bothers me clark said environmental groups get tons of donations their purpose is to protect and defend the environment if a big corporation like duke can come in and buy them off i have a real problem with that construction began in november on duke s project to add megawatts of natural gas fired electrical capacity to the moss landing plant purchased from pg e in if the expansion is finished next year as scheduled it would account for more than percent of all new generation in california in this is a big deal said williams the duke spokesman it will be the largest plant in california if that plant is delayed a month or two we lose the summer of and that affects not only duke energy but the state of california opponents say it s not the power they oppose but the plant s cooling system which will pump about billion gallons of seawater each day from moss landing harbor such pumping they say will degrade elkhorn slough they argue for an alternative cooling system such as towers that re circulate water basically what that plant will do is take percent of the volume of the harbor and slough run it through a pipe and dump it back into the ocean with much of the marine life cooked and dead said steve shimek executive director of the otter project for shimek and other environmentalists scientific studies commissioned by duke during the permitting process left key questions unanswered about the plant s impact on the environment there was no scientific evidence that would literally point to duke causing harm to the environment said vicki nichols executive director of save our shores we felt we didn t have strong standing to sue instead the environmentalists began negotiating with duke for financial payments for studies of environmental impacts of the modernization project the process gave me tremendous pause and great concern nichols said i knew there was going to be some perception that we were doing the wrong thing she was right as far as i m concerned with the price gouging going on by the energy wholesalers they are just receiving stolen goods said clark of the citizens group her skepticism was sharpened by the recent disclosure that duke energy approached gov gray davis with a secret deal offering financial concessions if the state dropped lawsuits and investigations into the power generator chabot with the center for marine conservation discouraged any comparison between the two offers calling it grossly unfair and inaccurate regardless of what was intended with the payments nielson said they stain the process it is so destructive in terms of making everyone cynical she said shimek took a different view we convinced duke to spend million toward monitoring that frankly five years from now could very well come back to haunt them he said did we do the right thing i have no idea did we try our best yes we did,0
mark attached is the letter agreement we discussed please review it is rough some issues to note the kern pa cannot be assigned without their consent which shall not be unreasonably withheld if kern didn t like the fact that we are receiving assignment from or other shippers they might withhold consent if they thought we were superceding their bid procedures not sure if they would but it is a risk if the assignment is done after the producer executes the firm transport agreement kern could require to capacity to be released via capacity release at max rate i took a stab at the mark to market calculation probably needs more substance though lets discuss,0

great article on what it truly means to be an auburn man the ties that bind friday night meetings have helped auburn through hard times  by phillip marshall times sports staff auburn it started in dark and unhappy times for auburn s football team five straight games had been lost late in tommy tuberville s first season as head coach the team was fractured divided by the stress of almost two years of trouble despair and losing   more auburn football talkin tigers forum   it was defense and offense offensive tackle kendall simmons said whatever happened we pointed fingers at each other on the friday night before last november s game against central florida a small group of players gathered at the team hotel at the urging of fullback heath evans they prayed they talked about life and the sometimes bitter turns it can take a bond began to grow among players young and old black and white starters and reserves it wasn t so much about winning and losing or even about football it was about matters of the heart we may have had guys show up that first night senior whip linebacker rob pate said since then it s just like another thing on the itinerary it s not mandatory but we have basically the whole team there we ve got five or six coaches coach tuberville comes in there people just lay out their hearts whatever is on their minds auburn has won seven of the eight games it has played since that november night players say they ve done it with trust and a unity of purpose that has grown ever stronger it has carried the th ranked tigers to a record going into saturday s southeastern conference west division showdown at th ranked mississippi state pate says they ll go firm in the belief that they can count on each other in the most difficult times pate knows about pain and even fear a mysterious disease now seemingly under control threatened his senior season when you see a guy at his weakest point and he s reaching out asking you for help you know everything about a guy pate said with me it was my health before the first game they set a chair in the middle of the room and every guy in there put his hands on me we said a prayer together man i was crying it s like that every weekend somebody on this team is suffering through something they share it when you line up on saturday it s a lot easier to look at that person and know he is going to give it everything he s got on the field there has been little but happiness for auburn this season tuberville says it started when auburn players strengthened by the bad times put aside their differences and their individual desires to play for their teammates and their school i ve never been around a team this close tuberville said they get along we haven t always played as great as we wanted to but we ve had guys urging the younger players and younger players pulling for the older guys to get better it s just a special group they enjoy being around each other and understand what it s going to take for us to win the change from not so long ago is striking simmons says if you don t really know each other and everybody is in their own little group things aren t going to work simmons said if you have trust in your teammates you can build a good team right now we ve got that going it starts with the seniors who have seen the good and the bad of college football they went to the sec championship game as freshmen in then came two losing seasons and the resignation of their head coach terry bowden they revel in their success yet they know it can be ever so fleeting they take pride in the closeness of a team on the way back no one understands better than fifth year senior quarterback ben leard he went from starter to third team in then won his job back in when hardly anyone thought he could today he has the highest efficiency rating of any sec quarterback we have been practicing since august and we have yet to hear anyone say man i m looking forward to playing in the nfl leard said no one is worried about their personal accolades or how they are doing status wise everybody just wants to win ball games the relationships we have on this team are like brothers leard says nothing that happens can change that if we lose every game from now on this will be one of the most special seasons i ve ever had in my life leard said we ve got people excited we re excited the fun is back in it for us it s a great feeling to be able to almost look forward to coming to practice to see the guys to have fun and talk there are no fingers being pointed anywhere there are no individuals on this football team evans was one who showed the way happily accepting the unglamorous role of blocker for tailback rudi johnson every friday night evans is still the one who leads his teammates as they share their joy and their pain heath is just like that all the time pate said he s a great example of somebody who lives what he talks he s a role model not just for younger people but for all of us,0

i ll be happy to accomodate i can take you through enron s view of how markets overall are evolving and how we approach those markets i d also like to spend some time reviewing interstate transmission policy and how it affects western energy markets steve reynolds sreyno state wy us on am to skean enron com cc sland enron com subject wyoming energy commission subject steve it was great to meet you and hear your remarks yesterday for the speaking engagement next wednesday i would like you to focus upon the enron strategic model of virtual integration of market forces in the evolution of energy development wyoming represents a huge material resource base and the commission is charged with the development and promotion of such but the governor s message is that we cannot see ourselves as producers and exporters in the traditional sense we will continue to have the status of a colony if we do not recognize the new dynamics of how these market places are evolving if you set the stage with a presentation of enron strategy then we will discuss how a state with its agencies and auathority can play a role in this evolution i have set your time for minutes which can include a short qand a period but your message can be as succint as you can make it and get the point across you may have to present the enron case a number of different ways but the governor will give you latitude to make the point you will be welcome to participate in a following panel which will address role playing by the state and the commission plan to join us for lunch if you need more detail let me know thanks stephen,0

were still standing firmly behind per metric on a fob richards bay equivalent and claiming it was heading swiftly to while there had been some nervous short covering by utilities in the month prior to coaltrans which had fuelled the mkt somewhat the buyers have remained disciplined and in general have refused to commit to these numbers the lack of business at these numbers has definitely moved the mkt south and of course mkt psychology with it while producers are still playing lip service to abve numbers they are actively putting up offers which reflect levels of fob richards bay and wud trade down to several sources have confirmed in the last cuppla days that negotiations between kepco and south african producers for price fixing tonnage fell apart which ultimately means there will be an additional million mt which the south africans have to find a home for destination europe most likely on the flip side kepco will be looking towards indonesia and china to substitute this tonnage and this combined with rumours that formosa plastic will be looking for some million tonnes of additional material from china cud serve to tighten the pacific mkt over the next months for first half there is definitely an intent within the consuming community to make a stand against the cartel and there has been a lot of activity over last three weeks with business being booked out of the u s indonesia and australia at numbers close to what was achievable from s a into europe this can only serve to strengthen our opportunities in this mktplace and indeed german utilities who have been held to ransom by similar minded producers in poland are now exploring every end to do business with other suppliers namely ourselves in order to avoid being captive to one supplier weglekoks incidentally are currently in the mkt buying russian material to cover sales made against polish to bewag we don t want to be short polish in the near term mkt now trading at fob barge ara for jan dec and level for the jan mar we still see couple dollars on the downside although the latest incident guerrilla attack on rail line last week has gary drummond threatening to cut production down in colombia by half

suggest there is increasing activity liquidity in the market with the arrival of several new players in recent weeks most notably aep increased volume in eol has also been mirrored by an increase in the volume of seca s traded in the otc market with more and more utilities who have upto now remained on the fringes deciding to join the party rwe has been the latest seca virgin to lose it s cherry closing a deal with ourselves early last week on q through tfs we are now offering our products in euros aswell the good old green back much to the confusion of one or two of our clients at current pace we shud have surpassed all our expectations by passing the mill mark by the end of the year gameplan we are currently long to the tune of mil mt but this is essentially all through optionality at origin which runs through to strip these out and effectively we are running a short ara position of some mill mt weighted pretty evenly across q q and q backed by some implied longs at origin through options and firm tonnage out of both richards bay and drummond we are very comfortable with this as we hold enuff bullets at reasonable numbers to go after the term cal business while running a

questions about what went wrong against stanford coach mack brown s respon se to the loss the continuing quarterback controversy ut players in the nfl  and more inside ut football appears every thursday   e mail questions to chip chipbrown dallasnews com    listen to chip brown talk about the longhorns on dallasnews com s colleges site    chip shots   every year since texas has lost or tied a game in its first four g ames of the season that means ut has had a blemish on its record each of the pa st years usually before texas ou weekend  orangebloods spend winter spring and summer discussing the impact of n ew recruits the prowess of future opponents and the talents of its returning  starters they spend money on season tickets airplane tickets and alumni  luncheon tickets they dream big dreams and then by october the high hope s have usually come crashing down  only three times since has texas opened the season and those starts were then immediately followed by either a tie or  losses and in each of those seasons texas ended up with four  losses  in ut s two best seasons since a campaign in and a  run in the longhorns lost their second and third games of the season  respectively before texas can dream about winning a national title the longhorns have to show they can make it into october without a loss     longhorn q a q judging from the stanford game as well as the last three games of l ast season it looks like the trend of blitzing the horns will continue there is also no respect for our running game from any team that we face i think th e best way to end this strategy against us is to become the aggressor on offense and not sit back passively and react to what the defense is giving  us  in order for us to achieve this i think it starts with us putting our b est athletes on the field on offense these guys may not be the most experience d players but they will gain experience with playing time and they have the  ability to make a team pay for selling out with the blitz it s time to sta rt roy williams and b j johnson at receiver along with montrell flowers and  play a one back offensive set our fullbacks are not a threat offensively a nd hodges mitchell is not an i back who is adept at following the fullback through the hole hodges strength is operating in space and making people  miss in the open field  i also think chris simms needs to get the bulk of the minutes at quarter back major applewhite has all the intangibles in the world but simms could and  probably does possess all of the same skills he just hasn t had the chanc e to display them we desperately need to have all playmakers on the field if  we are going to turn this thing around if not i could see this season slipping to real quick what are your thoughts chip the jackson residence  brown with any unexpected loss the tendency is to throw everyone out  change coaches players even the bus driver you do that and you are telli ng this team that you have absolutely no confidence in them there can t be to o much change at any one time the big question is how the team responds to  this stanford loss emotionally something tells me if texas can find some  resolve and perform really well you ll see some solid performances at all  the positions where problems currently exist in texas was no and  notre dame was no texas had the game won in austin and then lost ut th en lost three of its next four which included games against oklahoma state  oklahoma and colorado all teams texas is about to face after this week s  opponent houston  that was a different coach and different players but the common thread was that texas hit the top and then choked if texas is hung over from its  loss to stanford trouble could be on the horizon if texas can find resolv e to show everyone that stanford truly was a game in which everything that could go wrong did then i think the longhorns will bounce back and be a ha rd team to beat the rest of the way tuesday night mack brown said the longhor ns are not a very good football team right now the challenge has been made to  his team if they come out and stink against houston every position will b e scrutinized every coach even the bus driver there will be enough fire being thrown in austin to serve up grilled fajitas for the entire state bu t changes will have to be made constructively and gradually        image chris simms  q what s going on with the quarterbacks mitch golding  brown as the qbs turn this week it appears chris simms will start  because he was practicing with the first team on tuesday that has been the  trend whoever practices with the first team gets the start anyway we ll  see how they respond after the stanford game major applewhite was erratic in his play despite almost leading the longhorns back from the dead to a miraculous victory i m sticking to my theory that the coaches want to see  what simms can do against houston before picking one or the other  to get solo duty in the oklahoma and colorado games  granted if one struggles along the way the other will come in but mac k brown said they primarily went with applewhite against stanford because of  his experience and the fact that it was the team s first game on the road he said they still have all the faith in the world in simms it would seem to me that it takes away the incentive to really take control of the offense lig ht it up and get on a roll when you are alternating but i ll continue to watc h like everyone else  i keep trying to remind myself that brown did this twice at north caroli na with success of course with those qbs oscar davenport and chris keldorf  brown had different styles and gained an advantage by forcing the defense t o prepare for davenport s scrambling and keldorf s passing with simms and applewhite you pretty much get the same style with keldorf and davenport  you also had injuries dictate a few starts    q can you tell us what influenced mack brown s decision regarding the  quarterbacks against stanford nels marshall  brown here are brown s exact words experience we were in a tight  football game and major applewhite has been around a long time i was pro ud even with as poorly as we played offensively in the third quarter that we didn t panic i thought that in the fourth quarter the kids did a great job  of coming back and giving us a chance to win sometimes youth doesn t look  like it is trying because they re nervous instead they are trying too har d and get uptight our team tried hard as negative as people make saturday  night it is one of those things that you have to grow from    q i m glad we have two great qbs my question is are the receivers ha ving any problem adjusting to the different spin on the balls coming from a left handed or right handed qb dave stastny austin  brown the receivers say the varying spins are not a factor when catch ing the ball they do however say that chris simms ball will come a little  faster and a little harder than major applewhite s    q the longhorns are obviously going to play a lot of freshmen this yea r what are the rules on redshirting a player after the season starts i know  that a player can apply for a redshirt for medical reasons but can they al so apply for more eligibility or take a redshirt after playing a small amount of time chad graham  brown no once a freshman plays in a game even for one play and he d oes not suffer a season ending injury the chance for a redshirt is out the window        image jermain anderson  q have the coaches given any consideration to moving jermain anderson b ack to linebacker if i remember correctly he played lb in high school at texa s city he seems to still have good speed but also a problem putting on the  necessary weight to play defensive end it just seems like he might be bett er suited for the outside linebacker rotation especially considering the progress made by young defensive ends like kalen thornton cole pittman and  adam doiron micah hurt    brown coaches don t think anderson has the speed to play linebacker they are pleased with the depth at linebacker as well they like anderson s instincts as a pass rusher they are still working on his ability to stop t he run    q my husband wanted me to write and request that you put the longhorn  football schedule in your letter each week my husband mark is a diehard  texan who was transferred to oklahoma in through thick and thin he h as remained a loyal longhorn fan and taken a lot of harassment from the sooner  fans of course he does his fair share and probably more of

the team s mood during a game  about offensive coordinator greg davis i don t know who is responsible for the offensive line but since it is an offensive group in more ways than on e i put it under him with guys the size that ut has shouldn t even hodges  mitchell be able to run who tagged leonard davis as a pro why does davis  love mitchell sure he gained plus yards last year but how many of  those yards were move  the chains type of runs that allowed ut to hold the ball on the ground and protect a lead i thought it was going to be running back by committee but  all we have seen is the coaches continuing the same mistake abandoning th e run and using the wrong back for the wrong situations  mitchell can run to the outside but he cannot run through the defensive  tackles and even if he does get holes he still will never break through t he linebackers for a td why not put ivan williams or kenny hayter back there  with mitchell and go with a two back three wide offense you don t lose a  receiver as hodges is a nice smart receiver  other ramblings is quentin jammer really a corner he got beat many tim e against stanford i loved his hitting when he played safety but his injury  may have forever changed his game if he can t play safety and can t keep up  with opponent s wideouts  how is the defensive end position shaping up the defensive tackles were all over the field against stanford but the des didn t make much noise what i s up with the blocked punts ut should be really really embarrassed does stockton take too long is he too close to the line can the line block ca n anyone at ut block  does brown ride the officials who are missing holding calls several tim es the camera caught clear holds by stanford s line why on earth would you ru n up the middle on your own goal line against two of the best dts you ll pla y against andrew bowen  brown i think your feelings are shared by many texas fans who are incredibly pained shocked disappointed angered and hurt by last saturday s events but in talking to mack brown on tuesday he said it s fair to beat  the team up for not being able to run the ball but he said to jump on any  other part of the team is to rip young inexperienced kids who are still learning what it takes to compete as a top ranked team  to be fair to brown he did say repeatedly that his team was overrated a nd needed time to grow into some key positions receiver defensive end fullback and some positions on the offensive line and at corner it probabl y isn t fair to question whether mack brown can motivate because his teams di d beat nebraska twice oklahoma twice and texas a once if a trend develop s and texas falls apart the rest of the season there will be a fair question  about whether brown did a good enough job of keeping his team s head screwe d on straight but it s typical after losses to want to shred every part of t he team  brown said before the season that as soon as something went wrong the  quarterback situation would be blamed and he was right the qbs are still  working hard and look for simms to start this week against houston there s no question that the o line is struggling but so are the backs and so are  the receivers brown said only two of the five sacks were the fault of the  line he said the other three were caused by miscommunication between applewhite and the receivers causing applewhite to hold the ball too long   mitchell was standing too deep in the backfield against stanford so it was taking him too long to get to the holes the coaches were not happy about  that they were yelling at him to move up he should only be yards deep but he was sometimes at yards mitchell also struggled with some blitz pickup which is uncharacteristic of him so look for victor ike hayter and possibly williams to get a little time against houston  coaches are still high on jammer again he hasn t played corner much in  games after moving from safety but coaches are not thinking of moving him  the defensive end position is a big concern with defensive coordinator carl  reese he is willing to rifle through his whole pile until he finds a coupl e who can really play cory redding was better than usual against stanford b ut that position still needs a lot of work the blocked punt occurred because  one player who blocked perfectly on other punts saturday night failed to block a player coming right up the middle which guarantees doom that play er has been chewed out every which way  as far as the penalties there were several questionable calls but brow n who did a lot of yelling at officials during the stanford game couldn t sa y anything about it after the game because he would be fined texas can still  have a good season and perhaps having these problem areas pointed out so  early will help in that direction we ll see if texas takes this loss constructively or destructively    q last year at times i saw blazing speed and ability from cory redding i know he was considered by many to be the best high school defensive player in the country in i ve waited all off season to see him explode against  teams this year i haven t seen it yet maybe this week against stanford m y question is why was he moved from his high school position of linebacker  where he was dominant into the defensive end role where he seems undersized  and average is texas that low on defensive line talent it seems our recruiting has been great please help me understand hook em horns ernie mcanally  brown redding told me recently that linebacker is still his first lov e but he said coaches came to him last year and said he could get on the fiel d right away as a defensive end coaches also feel that his body i s perfect for the de position he s tall athletic fast and has long arms i n time coaches feel redding will develop into an all america player but the re is no question that he has struggled against the run he made some big play s against stanford recording six tackles three of them for losses and blocking an extra point attempt he is just a sophomore over this season a nd the next two years he should only get better   q i was watching the regional telecast of the tcu game today and the  announcers stated that tcu had anted up for the heisman campaign f or ladainian tomlinson how much did ut spend on its campaign for ricky williams run for the heisman  brown texas didn t spend that much money at all they produced a few  postcards a video and a cd rom screen saver to send out to the national media detailing ricky s accomplishments but those costs totaled less than  according to ut officials    q did any of the freshman who did not play in the louisiana lafayette game play in the stanford game i am watching to see which ones might be redshirts mike smith houston  brown according to the participation chart provided at the stanford t exas game austin sendlein was the only freshman to play against the cardinal wh o did not play against louisiana lafayette in addition to sendlein here are  the other freshmen who have played so far wrs roy williams b j johnson a nd sloan thomas te brock edwards de kalen thornton cb nathan vasher fs phillip geiggar and dt stevie lee    q is it true that in mack brown s four or five head coaching stops hi s teams have yet to win a single conference championship since ut has lost  four out of its last five games wouldn t a loss to houston this week officially end mack brown s honeymoon with the alumni notwithstanding his  abundant pr program with brown about to land his third national top recruiting class i believe fans are going to expect more gridiron victorie s to go with those recruiting victories t hough  brown it s true that brown has yet to win a conference championship i n stints at appalachian state tulane north carolina and now texas at appalachian state tulane and unc he was taking over absolutely dead programs he took tulane to a bowl and he had florida state to deal with i n the atlantic coast conference while at unc but he took unc to six bowl gam es in his years at unc and won four of them  a loss to houston would certainly intensify the frustration of texas faithful but i think anyone who would be looking to put brown on the hot  seat or rip him if texas lost to houston would be overlooking the job he ha s done beating nebraska twice oklahoma twice and texas a once in hi s first two seasons here he has also turned texas back into a destination school for top recruits and brought the ut community back together in addition to all that he has done more good for ut out of the limelight tha n probably most texas fans realize  brown is now in the same spotlight as bobby bowden john cooper lloyd c arr steve spurrier and phil fulmer any unexpected losses are unforgivable in t he eyes of fans it may take some time for brown and his team to adjust to tha t unc fans were pretty ho hum about everything the tar heels did in football  even when they won big brown wanted to win at a school with huge expectations he ll have to adjust now that it appears texas will be starti ng out the next few seasons in the top    q is lee jackson out for the houston game marty bonner  brown jackson is out for the houston game with a hamstring pull suffe red against stanford he may also miss the oklahoma state game mack brown said  this is a bad week to be without jackson because houston can throw the ball  really well    q is ricky williams jersey being retired at the oklahoma state game s ept  mark wilson  brown yes williams no will be retired at that game williams ha s said he will be there because the new orleans saints are off that weekend  host communications has also just finished a video biography on williams th at will be available soon    q what did mack brown say about the expectations surrounding his team after the loss to stanford virginia blair  brown again here are mack s words i said during the pre season tha t we were overrated i didn t see any reason with the youth the way we finished  last year and the inexperience across the board that we should have been a  top football team one of the great things about texas is that you receiv e a tremendous amount of attention and publicity but in some cases people wa nt to push you too fast to get to the top i think that we were in that positi on and expectations got out of hand i knew that we would have a difficult gam e at stanford and that it would be a tough game to win i also didn t think  that we deserved to be ranked fifth in the country our current rank within  the top is much more

paul quilkey enron development enron development cc subject ergon internet sep australia computers power supplier seeks vital spark on net by mandy bryan e strategy as electricity retailers prepare for deregulation ergon energy chief kim griffith is looking to the internet for competitive advantage around this time next year nsw and victorian consumers will be able to choose their own electricity suppliers ushering in a period of massive change for australia s electricity retailers among them will be queensland s ergon energy which now services customers and earns per cent of its revenue from the consumer market ergon chief executive kim griffith has chosen to make the internet a key part of his survival plan as he jostles for mind share there really isn t an established way of doing this because electricity has always been a monopoly and suddenly million contestible customers will appear in an industry that is probably turning over billion in sales a year he says while studies show australian utilities are lagging behind overseas counterparts in moving operations online ergon energy is considered to be at the forefront of internet adoption by an australian utility ergon s website allows customers to connect and disconnect their electricity service and submit complaints and enquiries if you look at electricity retail it is fundamentally an information based business and we will survive based on the information we can gather about customers says griffith he also hopes that by customers will also be able to pay their bills and select from more flexible pricing billing arrangements as well as buy products and services online the internet is an obvious way of doing business because it also allows you to increase interaction with customers at an appropriate cost we are now selling a commodity with low margins so a cost effective channel to market is key the to cost of over the counter transactions is more than times the cost of an internet transaction griffith says as electricity margins shrink he says ergon will increasingly diversify into non electricity and electricity related services and products we are looking to add value and differentiate in areas other than price we are releasing a number of products into our domestic market related to electricity and electricity consumption such as energy efficient light bulbs he says the next big challenge i ve put to my people is to put significant product on to the site and to generate real revenue but he acknowledges that winning in this market is not as simple as being first on the web ergon faces competition not only from traditional electricity retailers but also nimble virtual electricity brokers such as exco energy www exco com au and possibly banks and supermarkets woolworths for instance has flagged an interest in electricity retailing yet griffith believes that these same organisations also present opportunities to utilities given the reach of their established customer bases if you look at electricity and particularly the mass market there really isn t a channel to market griffith says in the future companies will be out there trying to create national brands as well as looking to alliances with established brands and channels to markets in addition to seeking such alliances ergon is building up its own customer database to hold and analyse the information it gathers from its website each time a customer hits our website we can gather more information and continue to build business based on that information for the time being though the major challenge lies in drawing people to its site we are offering a number of freebies on our site to get people used to visiting it he says ergon also has comprehensive educational information on its site relevant to the school curriculum which it is building up into a full virtual power station tour if we want people to keep visiting we have to keep increasing the value of the site to existing and potential customers griffith says there are two groups the ones that will not want to change suppliers in and those that do and they are the people who will be on board with technology

state puc takes on high cost of energy regulators foresee more rate increases robert salladay lynda gledhill chronicle sacramento bureau monday march san francisco chronicle url http www sfgate com cgi bin article cgi file chronicle archive m n dtl sacramento starting this week state regulators will begin debating how much is enough when it comes to asking californians to shoulder the electricity crisis by paying higher utility rates right now there doesn t appear to be enough money to go around the state government and the utilities have racked up monumental bills because of california s flawed deregulation system and even with recent rate increases not enough cash is coming in to pay off the debts and buy power over the next three weeks deciding how that money gets divvied up to pay the state s debt will be one of the toughest jobs of the year state treasurer philip angelides said the state public utilities commission would be essentially filling a shoe box with debts and commitments during a series of meetings and workshops this month and it s going to be a tight fit without raising power bills even more the rubber hits the road in the next few weeks at the puc angelides said there is a box that has to be filled up and a no rate increase scenario is putting all of these things into this box it ll be tough work under the law the puc has the power to essentially determine how much profit the utilities can make it s a set formula designed to give the power companies a comfortable margin and to keep power bills reasonable for consumers but with the deregulation an utter failure in california there are many more demands on that money the utilities claim to be billion in debt the state of california is spending million a day to buy power taxpayers have spent billion so far and the puc recently said utility customers would be required to pay that money back then there is the billion in bonds the state is selling to buy long term contracts for power angelides said the puc also must guarantee him an estimated billion a year from consumers to pay off the bonds which his office expects to begin selling by the end of may that money could end up running out by september or june under the most optimistic prediction angelides said that could mean california would have to borrow even more money beyond the billion money that consumers will most likely have to pay back through their bills gov gray davis has said repeatedly that it is his hope and expectation that rates will not increase but he has been criticized for seeming to say that a temporary rate increase approved in january will be made permanent and that a percent rate decrease imposed when deregulation was implemented will be lifted next year if i wanted to raise rates i could have solved this in minutes davis said last month but others are convinced now that rates will go up even more than the percent and puc commissioner richard bilas said he thinks the rates should go up before the summer to encourage conservation fundamentals don t change it doesn t matter what is done in terms of rhetoric legislation ideas or proposals at the commission the fundamentals don t change said bilas a republican there is not enough supply and too much demand the only function on the demand side is a rate increase otherwise people won t stop using electricity since the state is buying roughly percent of the power used by the utilities and at the highest prices so far the state should be entitled to an equivalent share of the money coming in from consumers if we re going to issue bonds we must have first crack at that money angelides said his office believes that a failure to issue bonds in the appropriate manner will directly and negatively impact consumer rates angelides also needs a commitment from the puc over how the state will get repaid for the money it s spending to buy emergency power the utilities cannot afford to purchase bilas said the puc which will take up some of these issues at their meeting on thursday would have to face reality soon it s a band aid it s the direction we have been moving in he said we re having to face up to fact that there needs to be rate increase what is being done isn t a solution to the problem it s a band aid the utilities among others are eyeing the money as well for their significant costs they have accumulated massive debts that need to be repaid and have investors to satisfy also looking for a slice of the pie are the alternative energy producers including wind and solar producers who depend on payments from the utilities to buy the natural gas they need to operate these facilities account for nearly a third of the energy produced in california and any scenario that has the state getting through the summer without significant blackouts requires full operation what everybody has told me is this summer is going to be murder because we don t have enough state senate president pro tem john burton d san francisco said recently three things are occurring that are designed to make sure the money going out to pay for debts and power is slightly less than the money coming in from consumers small alternative energy providers are expected to start getting lower payments utilities as part of a state rescue plan still being negotiated will be required to sell the electricity they generate themselves at cost the state is signing long term contracts for its share of power which reduces demands on ratepayers the idea is to leave enough headroom that will pay back the state for what it is spending over a long period of time angelides said the difference that headroom should be returned to the state to pay off the debts it incurred from the long term contracts financed with the bond money and to buy emergency power state wants its share we stepped into the breach here angelides said we re entitled to a fair slice of the pie angelides said the new rate schedule which the puc is determining this month should not be used to pay back utilities for any of their debts from before jan that s when the state started buying power for the utilities so far the utilities are not asking for their past debts to be repaid some other financing for those must be developed such as selling thousands of miles of electrical transmission lines to raise billions of dollars but there may not be much headroom left to pay off all the other debts chris danforth with the office of ratepayer advocates which is designed to make sure consumers get a good deal out of the puc said the future payments to the alternative facilities and contracts signed by the state were going to cost more than originally planned that eats up some of the headroom and is indicative of a rate increase danforth said paying the bill most of what pg e customers pay for electricity is spoken for but the demands are about to get a lot bigger breakdown of contributors to electricity production pg e generated power what the utility produces at its own plants alternative energy electricity generated by solar wind and biomass companies independent generators power produced at non pg e plants in california and elsewhere pg e customers currently pay cents per kilowatt hour combined sources of electricity cost cents per kilowatt hour this portion represents cents of leftover money claims on leftover money money owed to the independent system operator which has been forced to buy electricity at very high prices in recent months money owed to the alternative energy providers many of these small units have stopped operating because they have not been paid emergency power purchases likely to be necessary this summer since the state has not secured enough long term contracts to provide all the power it needs that could drain either the state s coffers or be paid for by consumers source chronicle research chronicle graphic e mail the reporters at rsalladay sfchronicle com and lgledhill sfchronicle

forwarded by phillip k allen hou ect on pm george richards cbpres austin rr com on pm please respond to cbpres austin rr com to phillip allen pallen enron com cc larry lewter retwell mail sanmarcos net claudia l crocker clclegal aol com subject investment structure structure typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate or llc general partner the general partner owns of the project and carries the liability of construction land ownership loans the property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership each of the individual investors and all of the principals in creekside would also personally guarantee the loans if the investor s do not sign on the loans this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor s share of profits is reduced all loans for residential construction that are intended for re sale are full recourse loans if we are pursuing multifamily rental developments the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non recourse use of initial investment the initial investment is used for land deposit engineering architectural design soils tests surveys filing fees legal fees for organization and condominium association formation and appraisals unlike many real estate investment programs none of the funds are used for fees to creekside builders llc these professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated month design and approval period early land costs the per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to months of extensions on closing as an alternative we can close into a land loan at probably of appraised value with a land value equal to the purchase price of this would mean a land loan of with estimated monthly interest payments of given a annual interest rate plus approximately of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees equity at improvement loan once the site plan is approved by the city of austin the city will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements referred to as the fiscals this cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that coa considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by coa this release will be for of the cost with the remaining released one year after completion releases can be granted once every days and you should expect that the release would occur months after the start of lot improvement construction these fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit as such they have to be counted as a development cost even though they are not spent because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds the lot improvement loan is typically of the appraised value of a finished lot which i suspect will be at least and potentially as high as this would produce a loan amount of on per lot with estimated per lot improvement costs of fiscals at and the land cost at total improved lot cost is which means to per lot in total equity the investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs thus the additional equity for the improvement loan would be even if the maximum loan would cover all costs it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent the higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side the engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement phasing works as follows if the first phase was say units the total lot improvement cost might average per lot of this probably would be for improvements and for the land cost the improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs the entry road water treatment costs perimeter fencing and landscaping and so on as well as for of the land the land loan for undeveloped lots would be of the appraised raw lot value which i would estimate as per lot for a loan value of per lot then the loan value for each improved lot would be per lot this would give you a total loan of total cost of for equity required of this was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the civil engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint construction loans there are three types of construction loans first is a speculative spec loan that is taken out prior to any pre sales activity second is a construction loan for a pre sold unit but the loan remains in the builder developers name third is a pre sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer we expect to have up to spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre sold units with loans in the name of the builder developer we do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process spec loans will be for to of value and construction loans for pre sold units if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender will be from to of value disbursements disbursements will be handled by the general partner to cover current and near term third party costs then to necessary reserves then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement the general partner will contract with creekside builders llc to construct the units and the fee to cb will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to of the direct hard cost excluding land financing and sales costs these fees are the only monies to creekside larry lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit except for a direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b direct payment to cb for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform for example if cb cannot find a good trim carpenter sub or cannot find enough trim carpenters etc and it decides to undertake this function it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership finally cb will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others at present cb does not own any significant equipment but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing cornice roofing and drywall spreading reporting we are more than willing to provide reports to track

leo well actually that is how i spell my name as well but not enron one of the drawbacks to working for a large company your analysis of the database structure and its intent is correct the extra table enables the use of a many to many relationship between regulatory items and facilities joanne and i previously discussed the need to keep track of all facilities referenced in a particular order this relationship allows users to query facility and review data related to an order for instance if an order required the upgrade of chlorination facilities at several plants one could develop a query and report that produced the results of all equipment inspections for the related facilities this would not be possible or at least not achieved as easily without the many to many relationship so yes you are giving up functionality so i would only consider eliminating the table if it would causing undo problems with the database as far as actually modifying the database there would be some manual labor required for those orders with multiple facilities already assigned i have to go but if you or joanne need to discuss it over the phone i d be happy to with a little notice mat,0

ees ees cc subject credit risk model comments at this point hi everyone i have run the model and along with the contract briefs i have some questions ideas i was hoping to talk to each of you so i could avoid writing this detailed one sided e mail but with our schedules being so exclusive this will have to do for now every deal has its own model because of the commodity deal structure complexity so no aggregate results can be obtained without having the mode ls for each contract however the jc penny s version can serve as a testin g platform for some of the items i am mentioning below i have not talked to  the people in research who are the most knowledgeable about the model so  some of these comments may be mute points i plan to do that went i get bac k since the credit risk is developed for a time period it makes sense to  regularly update the commodity data and credit rating if its chaged and  re run the model for the time remaining i would expect this is done alrea dy the default probabilities seem not to change that is if the input cred it rating is e then the e default probability curve is used for the contrac t period for annual accounting that seems ok but in mtm it seems to me tha t the credit analysis needs to take into consideration the credit rating transition probabilities that is the credit implications of companies changing their credit rating during the contract period with some constraints imposed by actually slow credits appear to change would give a  more realistic view of our credit risk in the mtm world are all defaults created equal to us look at oc it seems to me that  the data used to develop the default probabilities are over different business segments and are ok for that range of companies however we a re dealing with specific types of firms where default may not mean we do not  get paid sure we still have some credit risk but it s not like montgom ery ward s where the lights are being turned off for good energy is so fundamental for a company s success and default actions can be used as a way to save a company albeit in a different form so financial default does no t neccesarily mean default for ees commodity payments totally a while back someone said to me that may maybe the people who reach for a life preserver are more likely to live than those that don t by that i mean that perhaps our use of these default probabilities actually overstates th e credit risk in that if a company has at least enough proactive vision to contract ees then they are more likely to improve that one that doesn t  this is a type of behavioral variable that the data doesn t consider th is would be a useful mba project to examine these types of corporate variables  and compare it to their credit rating forward curve this leads me to something i hope we can acomplish in the special financ e team the contract briefs are to me the begimnning of this exercise if we can combine our customers into exposure group portfolios for lack of a  better term where a group has similar risk characteristics beyind the  current parameter set that we define then this offers a potential to shop  some of these exposure to specialized insurance markets a technical point monte carlo simulations are numerical experiments besides the model assumptions numerical experiments have three inherent error attributes the number of trials numerical roundoff and random numb er generator randomness statistical properties the first two are not a proble m in this application but the last one could be has anyone examined the effe ct of

looks like you got this earlier i think it has new relevance in light of ferc s announced investigation forwarded by steven j kean na enron on am  tim belden ect am to james d steffes hou ees ees cc jeff dasovich sfo ees ees mary hain hou ect ect susan j mara sfo ees ees mona l petrochko sfo ees ees bruno gaillard sfo ees ees sarah novosel corp enron enron ees paul kaufman pdx ect ect joe hartsoe corp enron enron ees steven j kean hou ees ees richard shapiro hou ees ees subject re ferc investigation in ca what should they be looking for here are some more thoughts ferc should take a hard look at why the iso is almost always in an inc situation in real time without structural incentives to go short into real time i would expect the caiso to inc in some hours and dec in others with no consistent patterns the iou s have four choices for purchasing power px block forward px day ahead px day of and caiso ex post they had ample opportunity to purchase lower cost power in the px block forward but didn t buy enough that left them short in the day ahead they can reduce day ahead prices by moving some of their load to the ex post market dave parquet did an econ presentation on this incentive at the caiso board meeting in june the iso remains primarily in inc mode even during the shoulder months when prices are lower another indicator that the real time inc problem is driven by the load side rather than the supply side the iou s continue to go short into the iso ex post market even when the caiso ex post price is consistently above the px day ahead price there is evidence that the iou s are not willing to pay above the caiso price cap for energy from the px in the day ahead market does it matter that the price cap for the iso also acts as a px price cap the nox market in california is very tight how has this contributed to higher costs and has the complete lack of available nox credits prevented any generators from running how large was the impact of the below normal water year on the supply side the attached presentation quantifies this effect in the northwest i have a theory on how hydro capacity completely overstates reserve margins in the west from an economic perspective i can go into more detail if you wish friction between california px and iso markets and other western markets for example why are actual flows going into the state yet prices out side of the state are higher another example of anomylous behavior is at cob on and there was congestion from california to the northwest those days in the day ahead market in real time the nw ended up being a net seller of about mw from the nw to california demand side we really need to press on this issue because all of the proponents of price caps claim that as soon as the demand side is workably competitive then there is no need for price caps is large scale economic demand response required for a competitive market what if demand response is there but at very high prices the demand response in california is a joke with mw of interuptible why did the utilities and the caiso only get around mw of economic demand response much of this response comes at mwh the assymetric treatment of supply side resources and demand side resources can be justified on environmental grounds but not economic grounds so why this assymetric treatment this gets to the question of the fine line between scarcity rents which are ok and market power which is not if power is scarce and demand truly values it at mwh then shouldn t that be the price at what price would the rest of the interuptible load economically curtail bottom line there are about mw of load that should be able to respond to price signals that chooses not to or values power at more than mwh burden of proof what empirical measures should be used to assess market power the reports published to date have been unimpressive the market analysis unit report for example does a bunch of handwaving and then concludes that there is market power but they never explain why i would think that proof might be something like this generator x sets price y of the time when loads exceed z mws or four generators set price of the time when prices exceed mwh they have all the data to be able to tell yet they don t provide any empirical measures the only test i ve heard of so far is the uc energy institute report that demonstrates that generators are submitting bids above their marginal cost the px report states that supply bids are fewer and at higher prices than last year they fail to mention the fact that there are fewer mw

should they be looking for as we begin to meet with ferc staff on the wholesale market issues related to ca problems i think that we need to put together a list of questions that ferc needs to be asking western power market participants the following are some questions that i think are important to have ferc ask i m sure there are more were california utilities underscheduling load into the px day ahead market how many mws did the ca iso procure during each hour during the summer how does this compare with ca iso procurement during has pg e changed its bidding behavior associated with its hydro facilities in are there baseload facilities that were operated differently in than in were any generation plants off line due to unplanned maintenance during summer how did the ca iso demand side program work why didn t more load participate what options did sdg e have to hedge its retail rates what were prices in the cal px block forward market on jan and may how high did natural gas prices go in california for generation during summer were other western power markets prices higher year on year did the ca iso board face political pressure to reduce bid caps is this appropriate for a ferc jurisdictional entity what specific details is sdg e referring to in its complaint on unworkably competitive ca iso markets can these be fixed quickly please add other questions jim,0

cc james d steffes na enron enron subject ferc staff investigations on midwest and southeast bulk power systems on ferc staff issued reports on its investigation of bulk power markets in the eastern interconnection these reports were the result of a commission order earlier this summer enron s federal regulatory staff christi charles yeung and sarah novosel provided a great deal of information for this investigation and joe hartsoe and donna fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of staff scott miller who recently joined ferc from pg e gen while the commission is under no obligation to take any of staff s recommendations the commission typically looks to staff for guidance on transmission and market issues importantly staff concludes that the commission should consider these options for the southeast and midwest all of which enron has been asking ferc to implement for several years reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that vius have to favor their native load through the calculation of atc and handling of interconnection requests while the staff hotline is used productively the commission can direct staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints the commission could require tps to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection rather than simply relying on the tennessee power order that utilizes the oatt timelines and procedures require tps to retain real time transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load internal generation to meet that load and imports and exports rtos should submit the basis and methods for calculating atc and ttc as well as standardized criteria for curtailment in addition since even such standardized criteria might not get to the root of the problem that control area still control generation the commission could require that each rto set a date certain by which it will create one control area regardless of the implementation of these two options the commission could standardize atc and ttc methodology staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities it is still viewed as different with a reaction of price caps staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional cost of service model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services details also the reports contain good summaries of the generation transmission state retail federal reg and other issues for the region midwest the midwest is dominated by vertically integrated transmission providers tps that control transmission generation and load as such they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to third parties and strong incentives to favor their own services staff received numerous complaints however due to the lack of information available from tps staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or wide spread at the very least the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access thus harming the liquidity of the market tlrs are the most important transmission issue in the midwest with an enormous increase in the region showed a decline in peak load from to and a growth in new generation since the price spikes even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes tlrs climbed to record numbers the tlrs were highly concentrated only flowgates account for of ecar tlrs and another flowgates in main account for in that region notably even though the nerc procedures for level tlrs mandate transaction curtailment of the tlrs in the midwest do not show any curtailment amount the total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted staff notes that tlr rules are established by nerc whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties while the commission has required certain nerc standards and procedures to be placed in open access transmission tariffs oatt where the commission has the power to enforce provisions under the federal power act in practice the commission has generally deferred to nerc on transmission reliability questions including the propriety of tlrs tlrs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier tlr procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints curtailment by fiat in addition the nerc idc can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate the impact could be mitigated by one control area per rto staff notes that the midwest state commissions did not petition ferc for price caps following the price spikes some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that nug construction increased in the midwest market participants must keep track of and follow a plethora of information in order to make energy deals submit reservations and provide schedules for service staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access including tlr curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols particularly for atc and interconnection requests and discriminatory conduct unbelievably key data was unavailable to staff such coincident peak load data system wide snap shots for days when tlrs were called and import export data this lack of data creates a market inefficiency because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time as such the market is risk adverse eschewing long term deals for short term transactions staff also noted that because the security coordinators often work for the iou there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the iou staff cites richard tabors paper transmission markets stretching the rules for fun and profit staff cites the lack of information on oasis or on the nerc web site particularly about real time tlrs and curtailments examples were provided to staff of transmission refusals when there were no tlrs posted and improper implementation of tlrs causing substantial financial loss the currently proposed midwest rtos may mitigate some problems however all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load these incentives will continue to remain until the rto exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions staff notes that the midwest is a balkanized region of control areas with no uniform method for calculating atc and cbm the result is that atcs can be different on different sides of an interface staff notes examples in inaccurate atcs and states that staff s own atc audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints staff is weighing follow up options the result of these problems is a lack of liquidity staff next noted the problems with unfiled business practices especially on the next hour market staff s audit of oasis sites revealed several areas of non compliance information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently with equal and timely access to data including atc cbm trm and load flow input data tps have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load this incentive will still exist under rtos if utilities are allowed to calculate their own atc as a consequence the commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff the commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the tps to retain data including current real time network status interconnection issues ipps need to be compensated for var support also staff cites a number of hotline complaints about tps seeking large deposits or failing to complete system impact studies timely one solution is to have the rto handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against ipps the current practice of requiring ipps to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region network service has inherent advantages over point to point citing the entergy source and sink order the commission has relied on passively receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants while staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread there is evidence of discriminatory instances southeast the traditional vertically integrated utility viu model has largely persisted in the se this continued control has vastly reduced the economic incentives to facilitate ipp activities in many cases the vius have dampened ipp involvement without violating any commission regulation due to the inherent flexibility of the current rules staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and manipulation of atc tps have shown little inclination to improve the transmission system and use many tlrs there is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development of markets in the se atcs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices tva despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets has acted as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the se this is significant because of tva s size and location ipps have reported tva s discouragement of siting in tva through excessive time to perform studies excessive fees and rejection of requests to perform interconnection studies in addition staff cites the florida sup ct decision against merchant plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in florida staff discusses the significant flow of power from the midwest to the se this summer much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power than the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices peak prices were radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts increased generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages se utilities reported that they have not used market based rates to extensively increase sales less used than in the midwest the se region lacks information which has retarded the staff s efforts to discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the se including atc and tlrs market participants seem to have less confidence in the se market than in any other market region this appears to be justified based on staff s investigations this lack of confidence discourages investment and participation in the markets staff concludes that the commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how transmission is allocated in the se rtos since there are market concerns that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations the investigation found numerous problems in bad atcs and ttcs and poor oasis postings in addition several oasis audit logs actually erased historical data staff thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted staff could not obtain summer demand data and the commission s lack of jurisdiction over tva made it difficult to obtain transmission access information the staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits in addition the tps have reserved a huge amount of network transmission capacity much of it reserved shortly after the ipp approached the tp to interconnect staff cites the recent skygen order in which southern denied skygen s request for transmission stating that the only option was the construction of an mile kv line that would take years to complete staff solutions include allowing network requests by ipps and limiting self build capacity in the incumbent s territory atc variations are a big problem in the se serc coordination of a standardized atc is a long process and may not be resolved soon without direction from the commission an improved method and improved communication are needed the se experienced a increase in tlrs this summer this increase raises the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive operation of the market in the se staff cites information provided by charles y that an ameren tlr was not implemented according to nerc criteria staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since tps do not generally refund transmission revenues when tlrs are implemented rtos must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints in addition rtos will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to tlrs however if control areas are retained vius will retain mixed incentives as noted in the midwest report the manner in which load is calculated weighs heavily on the value of this information this is an issue that the formation of rtos may not resolve eliminating native load exceptions ie treating all load equally and placing all transactions under the same tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision of transparent and standardized information finally staff describes specific problems with tva and fp l tva is a problem area for the eastern interconnect grid tva is a transmission bottleneck due to the many tlrs called this summer the current federal law and lack of commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of deep and robust power markets in this area tva simply has no strong incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service in addition the commission does not have full information on tva staff lists a number of complaints against tva including unjustifiably increasing the tag deadline and allowing tva marketing but not others to sink and park power staff concludes that recent proposals by tva to enhance the development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential a staff audit of fp l revealed violations of standards of conduct including confidential information on fp l s transmission system including interchange information for other entities posted on ems systems that were available to fpl s merchant function staff s report found that fp l does not have an established procedure for review of ems to ensure that information is not displayed in error it is up to individual managers discretion frcc web site report dated violations such as these undermine competition the reports

fyi this is an internal email of the svmg please keep confidential i ll be monitoring thanks best jeff   as you know the svmg energy committee plans to discuss variable pricing specifically severin borenstein s proposal at its next meeting on monday a copy of his proposal is attached as i indicated at last week s meeting i believe the svmg should consider endorsing the proposal with certain conditions for the following reasons it provides the broadest most transparent incentive to reduce consumption precisely during hours of shortage thereby reducing the chances of involuntary curtailments blackouts it creates a demand response to high prices thereby reducing the market power enjoyed by power sellers this may be one of the only factors contributing to a more reasonable stable wholesale price environment if there is no federal intervention it offers a financial opportunity for those users who are able to reduce their demand overall or shift their demand to off peak periods the following is a strawman draft of an endorsement by svmg for discussion monday i would point out that the strawman is silent on the question of whether customers who choose to opt out of variable pricing must be interruptible an issue of concern to some also i hope to have additional input from barbara barkovich before monday s meeting thanks peter evans  power prices paid by customers must create the incentive to reduce demand during specific hours of supply shortage and high prices this gives the greates possibility of getting through this summer without running up a staggering dwr bill and suffering through frequent blackouts getting people to reduce demand in response to higher prices would also reduce the market power of sellers we therefore endorse the proposal to price power use above historical levels and rebate for power use reductions below historical levels at the real time energy price our support for this concept includes the following conditions historical consumption levels which would be served under regulated rates would be based on last year s use taking into account the customer s historical load profile adjustments would be made for increases decreases in number of employees or number of square feet per electrical meter to account for changes in business volume historical consumption served under regulated rates could be adjusted by a ratio say to to build in some expectation of conservation participation all customer classes would participate in the absence of real time load data i e residential customers monthly consumption deviations from historical levels would be priced at the monthly average spot price alternatives for above baseline use it must be explicitly clear that customers have completely unfettered ability to procure power for their above historical power requirements on their own if they choose to this could include self generation bilateral forward purchases or purchasing at the spot price from the dwr sunset this approach should automatically terminate at the end of requiring government or regulatory action to extend it rtp proposal doc,0

george i am back in the office and ready to focus on the project i still have the concerns that i had last week specifically that the costs of our project are too high i have gathered more information that support my concerns based on my research i believe the project should cost around million the components are as follows unit cost site work builders profit sf million land interim financing common areas total since reagan s last units are selling for around i am unable to get comfortable building a larger project at over unit in costs also the comps used in the appraisal from austin appear to be class a properties it seems unlikely that student housing in san marcos can produce the same rent or sales price there should adjustments for location and the seasonal nature of student rental property i recognize that sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and foot rental rates that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas however we do not believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance after the real estate expert from houston reviewed the proforma and cost estimates his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic he feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around million we would not even be able to cover the interim financing keith and i have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above million we would like to have a conference call tuesday afternoon to discuss alternatives phillip,0

i agree with most of this but have found from experience that if you give originators the freedom to pursue deals with little restrictions the deal flow improves dramatically for eott we want to pursue acquisitions of energy assets period we do not need to limit ourselves to the crude oil business in fact a portfolio of assets would likely reduce the companies overall risk to crude prices second we want to avoid any additional exposure to commodity prices therefore fee based business structures are the best fit that would include pipeline acquisitions crude liquid natural gas co etc as well as fee based processing non qualified income based aquisitions are also ok as long as they are fee based type deals ie electric generation terminals are also an excellent acquistion for mlp s does this get to your issues thanks,0

recap here s a recap of our demo meeting with enron s global strategic sourcing group on tuesday demo went well in attendance for perfect were ian james m and david y enron s attendees were john gillespie sr director gss platforms processes decision maker pam tragesser gss operations mgr asst to derryl c sr dir gss operations john will director sourcing pipe valves fittings craig brown director sourcing chemicals oils lubricants shirley jo dickens wilson enron transportation services procurement mgr eugene ribaudo enron energy services procurement mgr ibuyit com team lead ken sommers enron energy services procurement mgr despite only having hour to present ian competently ran through a company and feature overview then blasted through a demo of ps and ppd we did not get to show pi they all bought in that this was a sophisticated sourcing tool that it followed their processes and would help streamline their operation only negatives we heard was that the m price tag was a show stopper and that they were trying to minimize rfqs and focus on release against agreements with revs at over b and a spend to match that their roi would be tremendous shirley jo said that her primary use of this system would be for any purchase over k which requires bids she does not feel that she has enough of these events to justify implementation in her ets group their current processes are basically pen paper phone and fax they do use rfq templates and excel spreadsheets they also model total cost of ownership evaluating the total lifecycle of materials they are using their homegrown auction platform dealbench and were trying to compare this against our system their transaction fees for using the dealbench system are minor so our pricing looks high but that would be comparing apples against oranges i will address this in the cover letter on the pilot proposal we will send questions that came up included what is the difference between maverick spend in procurement vs sourcing ian responded perfect reduces maverick spend during the sourcing cycle by standardizing company best practices and providing visibility accountability of vendor selection criteria how does the optimization calculation work ian gave basic explanation of input variables and ranking scoring don t feel we need to elaborate on this at this point possibly in future can we utilize a hands on demo to play with the system we suggested a pilot but also said that it might be possible to work something out over webex just to test drive a little more before moving into a pilot we agreed that the next step is for us to send a pilot proposal and they will get together either friday or sometime next week to review the proposal discuss their opinions and determine the next step  i sent the pilot proposal and cover letter out today by email after final approval by ian i will followup on monday to find out what their evaluation gameplan is and to suggest meetings so that we can get roi inputs to allow james to workup an roi proposal david m young manager enterprise sales perfect commerce inc embarcadero rd suite palo alto ca tel email dyoung perfect com sourcing the identification

maybe you should take the slot but in my view definitely not skilling i think you saw my thoughts about this conference in a previous email exchange with schroeder re littlechild also they re breaking my arms and legs about sponsoring k range i had a thought that maybe ebs could stream the conference as an in kind contribution the pr that ebs gets out of streaming might outweigh the cost of providing gratis i had only raised it as a thought though and am surprised to see it turn up in print tim and i had both had lee as a professor and i ve been talking him about this conference alot and have no problem delivering whatever the news is in fact i had already told them that they shouldn t count on us for this one but that we re always interested in working together best jeff tim belden

ve worked hard with these guys to try to make this conference the best that it could be but it ain t quite there so i d rather keep our powder dry and use skilling at another time not top shelf enough

i think asking david the question is a good idea kay wilson montjoy wmontjoy brunini com on pm to kay mann enron com cc subject re joint agency as reseller of power the first part of sec u supports your statement to purchase on behalf of its members to me that might support buying as agent in a way that the action of mdea would be a binding commitment of cpu however the second clause and to sell the same to its members would seem to go the other way also note subsections o p and q under municipal law in miss there is the concept that a public body may not delegate its statutory functions to others i know you can t do it when it s a discretionary public function being delegated to a non public entity i m not so sure about one public body delegating to another i d like to hear from david hunt on this kay mann enron com pm would you read that to mean the authority to buy power as agent for the cities seems not entirely clear but not entirely out of the question kay,0
sally thanks for the email and update i agree that we must do something quickly to resolve this i believe that you should interview for summer interns as an extension to your upcoming planned recruiting trip i know you were very happy with the summer interns from the energy management program at ou that you got last year i was surprised and the school was thrilled that you offered all permanent positions upon graduation we cant lose that momentum i am sure that each school s program is different and that most don t interview for summer interns this early in the year but from what i have learned about the ou schedule we will lose all the top candidates if we wait i am sure that is not what charlene and celeste were trying to accomplish with their guidelines please keep me up informed on this matter thanks and good luck with the students mike enron north america corp from sally beck pm to charlene jackson corp enron enron celeste roberts hou ect ect cc richard causey corp enron enron mike mcconnell hou ect ect subject hiring practices for summer interns while recruiting on campus recently i became aware that a decision was made at the program level to not interview this fall for summer interns in talking with students and faculty at the university of texas and university of oklahoma it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an internship with enron as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for summer interns i have communicated my concerns to lexi elliott and her manager shelley jones and was told by both that the decision to delay interviews for summer interns was made at a program level based on enron s staffing when i asked about the competitive data available regarding the practice of other firms on summer intern interviews i was even more concerned to discover that neither lexi nor shelley had that data it would seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for enron by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for our analyst and associates programs i have had conversations over the last two weeks with lexi and shelley with no resolution when they could not provide the competitive data to either confirm or eliminate my concerns i volunteered to have james scribner a senior director on my team obtain this market information lexi and shelley either did not have the time to gather this data or were not sure how to do so they were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this critical information i now have information at hand with regard to firms that will be recruiting at ut and ou this fall for summer intern positions and based on this information i believe that enron is at risk for not hiring top students as interns for the summer of if we do not interview for these positions this fall while my research only touches on two of the schools at which enron recruits i want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many if not all campuses that we have targeted for recruiting as administrators of the program you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to carry the enron message to campus i believe that we also have an obligation to make this a two way messaging system i strongly believe that we must address this potential risk for enron extremely quickly as teams will be on campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days i suspect that many enron participants in the recruiting process are unaware of the program s decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer internships in working with rick causey and mike mcconnell executive sponsors for ut and ou respectively they are as concerned as i about the decision on interviewing summer interns i have copied both of them on this note to the two of you please let me know how this can be resolved with the help of james scribner and others we have already compiled a list of students at ut and ou that should be targeted for summer internships i will offer as much of my time as is feasible to work with staff members of the program to devise creative ways to turn this around,0

vince j kaminski enron com cc subject re risk paper on pricing of electricity derivatives vince i can send you a scientific word dvi file at the weekend if you can read scientific word files the dissertation hasn t been reviewed by les or the external yet although its been at forc for months i think that the empirical chapter is probably the one which would be of most relevance to both our company s businesses although i ultimately didn t have the time to explicitly price the jump risk premium which i conjectured is possibly implicit in the prices of exchange traded electricity futures options rather i developed an implicit estimation procedure which will enable a rough assessment with a little bit of further work but not too much be made of the price of jump risk in wholesale power markets in other words i assumed spot jump risk to be undiversifiable and essentially devoted theoretical chapters to proving that a jump diffusion trading model is incomplete synthesising the securities markets framework with martingale representation theory note that i did not assume that markets could be dynamically completed with term structure securities as in the hjm w jumps papers of shirakawa and das and deriving an explicit risk adjustment process for implementing the price of jump risk using a jump diffusion marginal indirect utility of wealth process ie a jump augmented production economy approach in the spirit of cir bates ahn thompson incidentally i would be keen to find out if you or any of your team done much work on real asset valuations in a spark spread option valuation framework i m about to start a project evaluation of embedded optionality and have a dilemna whether i should model the spot or forward gas power price processes with the former i can model mean reversion and jumps explicitly obviously important for capturing the optionality of out of the money plant which might otherwise be ignored in a pure diffusion framework but am not maximising the informational content of the available market data that is assuming there was a long term market forward curve for electricity whereas in the latter the driftless forward supposition means that i have to capture mean reversion via the futures volatility function and jumps are less easy to calibrate any suggestions regards bernard original message from vince j kaminski enron com mailto vince j

hap could you provide a response and get it to meredith i d like to correct this forwarded by steven j kean na enron on pm joannie williamson am to steven j kean na enron enron cc subject red herring article thought you would like to see joannie forwarded by joannie williamson corp enron on am from chris hilgert ect on am to jeff skilling corp enron enron cc subject red herring article jeff i was recently skimming the enron news articles on yahoo finance and saw this one published in red herring about the sad demise of the renewable energy business in california http www redherring com index asp layout story doc id channel  i thought the article was reasonable until i got to a certain part about the impact that recent high prices have had on these companies and enron was mentioned in a rather improper light in my opinion below is a short excerpt from the article with a particular sentence highlighted concerning enron proponents of renewable power viewed california s deregulation as flawed from the onset three years ago still they anticipated that with adequate publicity millions of consumers could be persuaded to switch from the traditional power supply which comes mainly from the more polluting fossil fuels and nuclear power and that the demand would spur supply the number of producers and retailers getting into the green market would then only grow as long as the big utilities didn t interfere that s what almost happened over the last three years retailers like green mountain energy and utility com bought green power already available in california and started to invest in building their own renewable energy generators like windmill farms and large solar panel assemblies still for all the optimism and effort only about customers less than percent of the million households that had the option of switching providers chose to support them many of those were swayed by a deregulation mandated credit of cents per kilowatt hour for consumers who switched when natural gas prices were high the credit actually represented a real savings historically environmentally conscious consumers have paid a penny or two more per kilowatt hour for renewable energy along with an average monthly surcharge of then last fall the fledgling industry started to crumble energy wholesalers like enron nyse ene and calpine nyse cpn responded to a rising demand for energy by raising their prices from cents per kilowatt hour to as much as green retailers had trouble getting credit to buy power many chose to drop out of the market rather than have to charge a price that was less than their cost when the energy crisis hit many green consumers bills more than doubled in light of the recent e mail that was sent out i thought that i would bring this to your attention as it may warrant a response to bring clarity that enron does not raise prices it transacts in a market where prices are set by supply and demand the average person reading this could very easily come to the conclusion that calpine and enron broke the back of the renewable energy companies which is clearly not the case nonetheless thought you might find this of interest chris hilgert enron americas enron compression services,0

sharen cason in the confirms group will be expecting your phone call her number is i talked to her about the difference in energy types to satisfy my own curiosity and she explained that the caiso modifier acts as a flag to her group that the deal was done in california and therefore should have an np sp or zp delivery point if the energy type is caiso they need to include different language in their confirmation letter to the counterparty while caiso is still essentially firm energy it has different stipulations she said i didn t go into detail with her because the bottom line is that none of our real time deals should reach the confirms desk anyway i m working with it in houston and here to have west hourly deals default to no confirm but until that gets done your best defense from the constant nagging onslaught of petty deal entry error messages is to have your group check and double check that they ve marked their deals no under the confirmation heading more information than you ever wanted on this subject i thought so kate,0

randy what do other multinationals operating in brazil do jp morgan or citibank mark randy young enron am to sami arap sa enron enron robert c williams enron development enron development cc michelle blaine enron development enron development margalith elektro com br rob walls enron development john novak sa enron enron mark e haedicke hou ect ect subject re elektro s telecom project for what it is worth i agree with sami s concern that we may laboring under a false sense of security in assuming that a foreign arbitration provision in a brazilian contract between brazilian contracting parties relating to a brazilian matter in controversy would be easily enforced by a brazilian court inevitably we have to fight hard for these concessions in our negotiations and end up leaving a lot of enron consideration not to mention blood and sweat on the table to get these provisions inserted in our contracts if we are really being taken by these crafty brazilian lawyers like the former general counsel of the odebrecht group i think we should re think the policy in this specific instance elektro because it is the fifth largest electricity ldc in brazil has a long history of litigation in the sao paulo courts we had a number of cases you will recall when we bought it and have had others since it is clearly not the only substantial high profile brazilian company enron has down here making it a little hard for us to negotiate these provisions as foreigners the way we do elsewhere by all means we should check with jose emilio but if he shares sami s and i have to say my concerns i think we should consider making a special rule for brazil to brazil contracting transactions perhaps we could have the first position be icc arbitration in sao paulo in english with a forum savings clause that states that if the arbitration provision is held unenforceable that the litigation will be in the courts federal if possible of sao paulo the worst thing that could happen is that we enter into an arbitration provision thinking we are safe and end up in some court in a smaller city in a backwater part of brazil where they are a little loose on the law and perhaps even looser on the concepts of justice due process etc if you would like me to be involved in the further discussions let me know randy sami arap am to robert c williams enron development enron development cc michelle blaine enron development enron development margalith elektro com br randy young enron development rob walls enron development subject re elektro s telecom project thanks again bob i will call jos emilio to check i agree that a foreign arbitral award is enforceable in brazil whether international or local aspects are under discussion provided that you follow the exequatur procedure at the brazilian supreme court i have personally participated in the enforcement of a foreign arbital award against odebrecht a few years ago however the point i am raising is that in case one of the two brazilian contracting entities challenge such foreign arbitration clause and refer the matter under dispute to a local court it is most likely that the brazilian judge will accept jurisdiction and review the case in accordance with article i ii iii of the brazilian civil procedure code in such event if enron please note that i am always only referring to an enron brazilian entity agrees to a foreign arbitration clause with a brazilian counterparty it may end up resolving its contractual disputes at the brazilian courts and this is exactly what i am trying to avoid by suggesting icc arbitration in s o paulo for all contracts entered into between two brazilian entities even if the two brazilian contracting entities refer the matter under dispute to foreign arbitration and at the same time or at a later stage one of the parties decide to challenge the foreign arbitration clause and refer the matter to the local courts it is most likely that the brazilian supreme court will recognize the local courts jurisdiction and decide that the foreign arbitration clause was null and void i will be in houston on friday january and would very much appreciate the opportunity to discuss this matter in detail with you and possibly with rob walls and or jim derrick regards sami robert c williams enron development pm to sami arap sa enron enron cc michelle blaine enron development enron development margalith elektro com br enron randy young rob walls subject re elektro s telecom project sami i agree on the issue of brazilian law but on the question of foreign arbitration our advice has been that such a clause will be enforced by the local courts even if the dispute has no international aspects other than the parent is foreign although there was a dissenting opinion from one lawyer on this issue could you check this point with jose emilio pinto at tozzini or fernando serec as to local arbitration we have accepted this where the dollar amount of the disputes is likely to be less than we should probably also have a cumulative cap of say million on bigger deals rob orjim have resisted local court jurisdiction the most flexible they have been to my knowledge where more is at stake is to agree to icc administered arbitration in sao paulo in this case i think we should propose the local arbitration procedure which would is best calculated to result in an impartial award whether that be ad hoc icc fiesp or canadian brazilian c of c jose emilio would have a view on this too hope this is helpful bob sami arap enron pm to michelle blaine enron development enron development robert c williams enron development enron development cc margalith elektro com br subject re elektro s telecom project michelle and bob thanks for the reply the issue here is when brazilian entities only are entering into a contract which obligations will only be performed in brazil and such agreement is governed by brazilian laws my understanding of the enron arbitration policy and please correct me if i am wrong is that when enron as a foreign company is dealing with foreign governments governmental agencies or government owned companies or private companies from the host company we must follow our internal policy by choosing preferred arbitration rules preferred place of arbitration and preferred governing law in case of elektro as well as any other brazilian enron entity eas ece etc entering into a contract with another brazilian party with obligations to be performed in brazil such contract will most likely be governed by brazilian laws although the parties are in principle able to select a foreign law in brazil the contracting parties must comply with local public policy i strongly advise that two or more brazilian parties contracting obligations in brazil agree that the respective contract be governed by the laws of brazil with respect to the dispute resolution mechanism we are all aware of enron s policy to avoid referring disputes to the brazilian courts in case of the above mentioned elektro deal the idea is to submit all contract controversies to arbitration under icc rules in s o paulo to me the question is whether we use ad hoc arbitration or institutional arbitration i e submit the matter to fiesp or the canadian brazilian chamber of commerce to act as the arbitration administrator fyi since i joined enron i ve been told that all of enron s brazilian entities should use foreign arbitration as their contracts dispute resolution mechanism in my opinion this concept may not work the way enron wants if the local enron entity is dealing with another brazilian party and suppose both parties have agreed to use icc arbitration in ny it is most likely that in case the brazilian counterparty decides to refer the matter under dispute to the brazilian courts the local judge will accept jurisdiction and review the case you may ask why the reason is because there are two brazilian parties contracting obligations to be performed in brazil under the laws of brazil as a consequence a local judge will accept jurisdiction i d very much like to emphasize that while working as general counsel of the odebrecht group i use to accept foreign arbitration clauses in contracts entered with affiliates of foreign companies because i knew that at the end of the day i could always challenge the dispute resolution mechanism agreed in the contract and refer the matter to the local courts since odebrecht s counterparties did not do their homework properly arbitration was first introduced in brazil through the federal constitution of the civil code of ractified the use of arbitration however it obliged the arbitral award to be reviewed by the local courts only in with the issuance of the brazilian arbitration act law it was recognized the use of arbitration as a definitive dispute resolution mechanism without having to submit the final arbitral award to the review of the local courts with respect to enforceability please note that the arbitral award is final binding and enforceable towards the contracting parties only in case a party decides not to comply with the final arbital award the other party may refer the arbitral award to a local judge to obtain an exequatur please feel free to contact me at the earliest possible convenience to continue to discuss this arbitration matter rgds sami robert c williams enron development pm

holli we need to talk about status i spoke yesterday with three eweb lawyers and dick varner i have to comment back on the schedule to the master agreement eweb has not yet reviewed the credit support annex and needs to submit their proposed legal opinion eweb is reserving discussion of the confirmations pending resolution of the master agreement most important however is the eweb legal opinion which will be limited by the capacity of eweb s traders to enter into financial trades at any given point in time eweb is insisting that we assume the obligation of knowing whether an eweb trader is authorized to act and how that eweb trader is authorized to act under eweb s trading policy because under oregon law and the law of all states financial trades executed by unauthorized persons employed by governmental entities are completely void your two trades which began as physical deals and were transformed into financial deals were authorized by eweb s recent board resolution however you cannot rely fully on this resolution for future trades before you ever trade with eweb again you will not be able to rely upon your past relationship with an eweb trader you will first have to conduct some due diligence with respect to the eweb trader and the eweb trading policy ena has never agreed to this type of arrangement let s schedule a time to discuss the agreement further thanks sara,0

stuck on the phone so i thought i d email you stan has asked mike moran if tw has any potential exposure on the high value transport deals under anti gouging statutes or common law you know the laws that say you can t charge per sheet of plywood during a hurricane or for a bucket of water during a drought i think we need to research two things are there any such laws applicable to our business cal state law would probably be the best place to start could the political regulatory fight in cal about power and gas prices ever expand all the way to our transport pricing i e if the cpuc whacks the power sellers for taking unfair advantage of their monopoly power its not a big leap for the cpuc or ferc or even u s congress to whack gas sellers for jacking prices up to mmbtu as happened on friday if that happens its just another small jump to whack us for charging for transport or so the logic goes i d like to hear preliminary views by monday am so i can talk to mike before stan s staff meeting no written memo necessary based on that prelim research we can decide what else need s to be done thanks df,0

don t know the answers we need to visit with herman manis to get his buy in on an approach i have a call in to him on another transaction so i ll ask are you in houston today ckm from greg krause enron enronxgate on am to kay mann corp enron enron cc subject sdec certosa holdings option agreement does the first option need to expire or can we terminate prior to expiration and concurrent with execution of a new option agreement i got a call from the owner of certosa holdings pleading for help on reimbursement of those legal fees if we are going to pay a flat fee and renegotiate this agreement i think we need to do so quickly regardless i need to tell them something soon they are getting desparate i ve a call in to taffy milligan aew s assistant to locate the shutts bowen invoice i understand we have engaged shutts bowen in tallahassee to review some property tax issue cound this be an avenue to avoid this on balance sheet hard cost thang original message from mann kay sent thursday may am to krause greg subject re aew s backup unless the first option expires and the original premium is expensed you add the original payment to the renewal premium to determine the percentage if we can t beat the percentage game we can have the land on the balance sheet and that won t put the entire project on it don t ask me to splain that because i can t if the land is going to be on the balance sheet you would think that it would be better to have on than however one thing i don t know haven t asked is what the environmental restrictions are with our financing vehicle i don t know if the land has to be clean before it can go into the vehicle i can ask if it is required to be clean then you may be back to the anyway kay ps feel like alice in wonderland yet from greg krause enron enronxgate on pm to kay mann corp enron enron cc kathleen carnahan enron enronxgate subject re aew s backup yes we do want to renew the option through september of next year and we will need to persuade them to lower the option premium her is a thought the land fill closure cost is approximately million could we create a new option agreement that states that the strike price is million the original strike price plus the cost of land fill closure cost so we could pay an option premium of up to of million at closing we reduce the purchase price by the costs yet to be incurred in the closing the land fill since certosa holdings will not start the closure until they are assured that we will exercise the option if even then the net cost to us would drop back to the original strike price could we get this past the accountants only the memorandum of option was recorded original message from mann kay sent wednesday may pm to krause greg cc carnahan kathleen subject re aew s backup i ve skimmed it i see that the option expires august th are we planning to renew it if so maybe we can renew early and fix what we can to preserve some optionality no pun intended and cover the fee issue might take too long to address the immediate issue i don t see anyway we can get around the balance sheet issue unless we let the option expire and then reoption but in that case the option payment would have to be smaller acct says an option of creates a problem as it would be considered a down payment just fyi kathleen was the option recorded or just a memo of option or neither i m just wondering what is public info herman is out of the office today but i can discuss the fee issue to get his vote more to come ckm from greg krause enron enronxgate on pm to kay mann corp enron enron cc subject re aew s backup i think the invoice was for between and but i can t remember aew has the invoice this probably will not be the final as we will need to work with them in discussions with derm on delaying the landfill closure and in moving jurisdiction of the project from czab to the county commissioners i think shutts bowen who may get stiffed by their client if this deal blows up and certosa holdings would be open to any suggestions and we need to renegotiate the option anyway shall i call and suggest this this flat fee for retooling the option agreement to them or shall we do it together i m not sure i could explain to them acequately the idiosyncrasies of our accounting requirements original message from mann kay sent wednesday may pm to krause greg subject re aew s backup how much is it and should this be the final amount one thought i have is that maybe we can retool the option agreement so that we pay them a flat fee which is enough to cover the expenditures don t know if this works but it is one thought what do you think kay from greg krause enron enronxgate on pm to kay mann corp enron enron cc subject re aew s backup one more thing on the sdec project according to the option agreement we executed last october we agreed to reimburse certosa holdings for actual third party costs that they incurred in support of our necessary applications submittals and in seeking local approval several weeks ago we recieved an invoice from shutts bowen attorney for certosa holdings requesting reimbursement pursuant to the contract i forwarded this invoice on th ann elizabeth not necessarily to pay for but to review considering this whole soft cost hard cost discussion i recieved another call this morning from shutts bowen asking about the invoice what should i do original message from mann kay sent wednesday may am to krause greg subject re aew s backup greg you can call me on whatever you have including midway sdec and medley dunn if i have a problem getting to something i ll find help kay from greg krause enron enronxgate on am to kay mann corp enron enron cc subject re aew s backup kay ann elizabeth did not provide a designated hitter for the south dade energy center dade development company llc is optionee certosa holdings is optionor nor did she provide one for tne medley dunn project i have been told that the dunns are considering backing off their ultimatums that they gave ann elizabeth and i regarding taxes to the town and assumption of enviromental liability who do i talk to about the dunn contract while ann elizabeth is out

great to hear from you looking forward to meeting in houston for a baseball game conway will be in corpis soon so we should be able to do a weekend we should start construction on the house in may what an incredibly long process it is i definitely would not do it if i had to do it over again one redeeming factor is that we bought on a good block we definitely have the ugliest house on the block we should get a pop in real estate also when all the california companies start migrating to texas joking aside unless you guys have incredibly mild weather this summer combined with a lot of rainfall you re summer will suck there is no doubt that the ca economy is going to suffer a great recession you have a shortage of supply so the only way to ease the problem is to reduce demand this usually occurs when prices reach levels where the price sensitive buyers cut back however with your boy grey davis pushing for price caps this won t happen the next way for demand to be trimmed is for companies to leave so this will probably need to happen to an extent for the problem to ease the other factor of course is that you could have an increase in supply new power plants but being that the amt of time it takes to develop and build a power plant in ca is about times as long as in most other states combined with the fact that ca hasn t had a new power plant in the last years an increase in supply doesn t seem likely in the short term again this is only my opinion so you could take it with a grain of salt talk to you soon kevin,0

first of all i m delighted you want to stay and would not have a problem with deron moving in however in return i would ask for increased rent of to take into account the improvements you want and additional water use and wear tear after you read this let me know whether you think this is reasonable i ll try to answer all your questions q i believe you had mentioned some termite issues and i wanted to make sure that we would not be doing anything to cause the floor to collapse as we would be removing light items for heavier items a i really do not think it is a problem in addition to the oak floor there is a subfloor so heavier items should be fine i d draw the line at a waterbed though q the stove is a bit problematic a no problem to look into this i m sure it can be repaired i will give the appliance folks a call q do you know if the garage apt would support a nd line being installed a i m sure it will go ahead and do it if the phone company runs into any internal wiring problems let me know and i ll call my phone wiring dude q do you know if the washer dryer connections in the garage part work for sure a i have a bad feeling about those connections i ll get them up and running and can get someone to haul the old washer off q i am guessing that they would need to be gas not electric a i would strongly recommend a gas dryer because it is so much more economical plus you would not believe how much faster you can get jeans and towels dry than with electric if i have to get a new connection installed it will be gas if possible q at one point you had mentioned doing something with the kitchen floor as the linoleum has seen better days would it be possible to look into this a i have always thought linoleum in a black white checkerboard pattern would look really cute in there it s cheap to install and fairly easy except i m leary of taking on the project myself because pulling up the old stuff is going to be a you know what i will call ask my handyman unless you and deron are just dying to do it yourselves q do you know if any paint is leftover a the color i used on the trim was antique white semigloss there should be some left in the garage i ll check and if not i can pick up some for you at the paint store as i ll be going there this week or this weekend the only additional issue i have is parking dianna is staying with me and helping w rent for the next several months and i d like her to be able to use that middle space i know it s a pain but either you or deron would have to park on the street the other option is to get one of the back garage doors working so there is access to the garage from the alley if i did this do you think y all would use it or is that too impractical as for timing with the oven w d connections and kitchen floor i m taking the first full week of sept off and it would be easiest for me to get everything done then if that s okay with y all call if you have further questions,0

wall street s dirty little secret it was the spring of i was just a tall goofy looking kid in middle school with buck teeth and freckles each day in the cafeteria i walked from table to table stealing other kids lunch money no i didn t rob them with a gun or a knife i just made them a little deal let me borrow two dollars today i said and i ll bring you five dollars next week the investment was too good to pass up and other kids were throwing their lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes of course when next week rolled around and i couldn t pony up the cash i promised to pay them even more the week after that if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit longer eventually the end of the year came and went high school started and with it came girls and homework and parties and sports and those poor kids from eighth grade had more things on their mind than last year s lunch money i made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid and i didn t even get beat up hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market secrets you will ever learn first of all greed is your number one enemy you re not going to turn into in a week so cash out when you re ahead don t wait for the boat to sink before grabbing the lifejacket second never trust an investment adviser of any kind they are looking out for their own money not yours the professionals those stuffy investment counselors and money managers will always tell you that the best time to buy is now according to those guys the longer you keep your money in the market the more money you re going to make ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is never in a sense they are right if you put in an index fund right now you ll probably have over a million dollars in thirty or forty years but here s the problem do you want to wait thirty or forty years to be rich hell no you want the money now so you can enjoy it it s hard to make use of your fortune when you re seventy years old in a wheelchair if you could make a million dollars in the next few years what would you do with it where would you travel what kind of car would you buy the fact is youth is the best time to be rich if your goal is to make quick profits in the market volatility is your ally and stability your enemy you want to see those large upswings two hundred points in a day followed by the four hundred point crash a week later you don t care if the market went up or down this year as long it was unstable that s how you re going to make the money what i m talking about here is day trading my father invests the traditional way he holds some good stocks and he goes up k and down k in the long term of years he makes money the day trader buys or sells shares of xyz for a profit in a minute trade he acts quickly taking advantage of all the information at his disposal about a certain stock and estimating whether it will go up or down within hours sometimes within minutes i can teach you how to do this and how to make amazing amounts of money at it it s not rocket science and you only need to learn a few basic principles to get started society would have you believe that successful trading is complicated and requires formal training the truth is wealthy people use very simple investment strategies to make money popular media and investment professionals portray successful trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing ring they don t want the competetion and they sure as hell don t want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm to execute a trade for which they d charge you forty or fifty dollars they make their money only if you believe two lies that investing is too difficult and risky for the average person that using an investment adviser who charges a high commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks per trade here is what the financial gurus in today s society absolutely positively do not want you to know the strategies for

urgent contact from the desk of dr tom eke e mail dr tomeke spinfinder com lagos nigeria attn request for urgent business relationship it is with my profound dignity that i write you this very important and highly confidential letter first i must solicit your strictest confidentiality in this transaction this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret though i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried considering the fact that we have not met each other before but i am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day we have decided to contact you by email due to the urgency of this transaction as we have been reliably informed that it will take at least a minimum of two to three weeks for a normal post to reach you so we decided it is best using the e mail which is quicker and also to enable us meet up with the second quater payment for the year however let me start by introducing myself properly to you i am dr tom eke a director general in the department of petroleum resources d p r and i presently head the contract award panel incharge of contract awards and payment approvals i came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential business transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence i and my colleagues are top officials of the federal government contract award panel our duties include evaluation vetting approval for payment of contract jobs done for the d p r e t c in order to commence this business we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said funds the source of this funds is as follows in the second quarter of this committee was mandated to review and award contracts to the tune of us million us dollars to a group of five firms for the supply construction and installation of oil pipe lines in warri and port harcourt during this process my colleagues and i decided and agreed among ourselves to deliberately over inflate the total contract sum from us million to us million united states dollars with the main intention of sharing the remaining sum of us miilion amongst ourselves the federal government of nigeria has since the second quater of year approved the sum of us million for us as the contract sum and the sum of us million has also been paid to the foreign companies concerned as contract entitlements for the various contracts done but since the companies are entiltled to us million dollars only we are now left with us million dollars balance in the account which we intend to disburse amongst ourselves but by virtue of our positions as civil servants and members of this panel we cannot do this by ourselves as we are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau civil service laws from opening and or operating foreign accounts in our names while still in government service making it impossible for us to acquire the money in our names right now i have therefore been delegated as a matter of trust and urgency by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner into whose account we would transfer the sum of us million hence we are writing you this letter my colleagues and i have agreed that if you or your company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our behalf you or your company will retain of the total amount us million while will be for us officials and the remaining will be used in offsetting all debts expenses and taxes incurred both local and foreign in the cause of this transfer needless to say the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous in return we demand your complete honesty and trust you must however note that this transaction will be strictly based on the following terms and conditions as we have stated below a our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence b that you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and confidentiality c that you will not ask for more share or try to sit on the funds once it is under your custody or any form of blackmail d that upon receipt of the funds you will release the funds as instructed by us after you have removed your share of from the total amount please note that this transaction is legal and risk free and we hope to conclude this transaction seven to fourteen bank working days from the date of receipt of the necessary requirements from you we are looking forward to doing business with you and solicit your total confidentiality in this transaction there is no cause for alarm i give you my word that you are completely safe in doing business with us transactions like this have been successfully carried out in the past by most government executives here in my country there is great economic and political disarray and thus looting and corruption is rampant and the order of the day thus explaining why you might have heard stories of how money is been taken

i still had pimples george burns it s summer vacation time and parents will soon be hearing from their kids that they re bored one of the biggest regrets we hear from the older generation is that kids lack the playful imagination that was common a generation or two ago back in the olden days kids knew how to entertain themselves with surprisingly little there was no such thing as playstation kids ran outside to play kick the can in a game that was shockingly not organized by adults they actually did it themselves today mike shares some thoughts about kids and modern imagination or lack thereof

http www pocketwarmers com d just imagine by michael t smith when i married ginny i gained a new son daughter and four grandsons i became an instant grandpa over the july th holiday i got to meet my new daughter and her three boys for the first time it took a day for my new grandsons to warm up to me the first day they stared at me perhaps wondering what they were supposed to do with this man who they were told is grandpa i waited patiently i knew boys like to play they d come to me in their own time on day two the oldest two were doing summersaults over my lap the youngest ben took a little longer but yesterday he raced me across the yard thirty times and won every time the weekend brought back memories of my own childhood we had such imaginations in our minds a tree was a tower to spot approaching bad guys a big rock became a mountain a fallen log a space ship headed to the stars we had toys but we had to use our imagination not like the new toys i see my grandkids with our toys didn t talk and if they did you pulled a string to make it work we had blocks to build crayons to create trucks and cars to push they were simple toys that required imagination i thought about the toys in my garage the ones i saved when my children outgrew them they were simple and needed their imagination to work mr potato head allowed them to learn parts of the body and giggle at the funny face with an ear where its mouth should have been i still have an old plastic phone it has a dial to turn a bell that rings when you push a button and that s it it doesn t talk squawk beep or move around the room it s simple and was used when they played house nurse doctor and secretary i have a toy doctor s bag with all the plastic doctor s tools i remember all the broken bones cuts bangs scratches and aches my daughter repaired as i lay in her office moaning most toys today do it all we don t need imagination it comes in a box video games that take us into another world or reality talking toys with vocabularies better than most people computerized toys to teach the alphabet kids sit and have imagination brought to them the teaching toys are great but children tire of them it s like being in school when my son was young and tired of his toys he would come to me and say dad i m bored go find something to do i d reply i don t know what to do go outside and find a friend naaa i don t want to do that use your imagination huh he asked well when i was young you know the routine sports is the same we re entertained for hours watching someone else have fun doing what they re good at wouldn t it be better to be playing yourself if we don t like the sports available to watch we create new ones it doesn t matter what people will pay to see it because they need to be entertained i haven t heard of world championship worm digging but if someone offered a large cash price people would buy tickets to scream at the contestants i worry are we becoming a society that needs outside influence to have fun i think i ll go climb a tree maybe there s a pirate ship on the horizon or someone is attacking my castle just imagine michael t smith michael lives in new jersey with his new wife and son from our mailbag in response to last week s story cinderella men dear heartwarmers last week s heartwarming story opened a door to memory lane i too was born in the s and felt some of the poverty of that time i remember my mom and dad who never complained of the fatigue that was so ever present in their lives we were very fortunate in as much as we always had plenty of food and warm shelter we had a garden and salvaged every edible product available even certain weeds that were quite tasty after mother got all the spices in them i had several beautiful dresses made from feed sacks that i wore with pride we were very poor but so rich indeed because we had love and the knowledge that god was upper most in our lives and it taught us lessons that had never been printed in the books i deeply appreciate those lessons of long ago because they have taught me how to handle the tough times we have encountered in this life of prosperity and promise thank you again for your lovely

stephen white head up company dedicated to bringing the next generation of online gaming read full interview the asian market according to the diffusion group and game trust china will become the online gaming market by more investors are making huge gains as the world bets online could gaming transactions inc gtts be the next stock to rock recently we read an article in the economist that highlighted online gaming and how it has become a socially acceptable form of entertainment over the next few days as we thought about what sort of impact this trend could have we started to notice that online gambling was being discussed all over the media in newspapers online and on television it became obvious to us that more and more people were jumping on the internet to bet on games we also came across some staggering statistics merrill lynch for example has predicted that gambling has the potential to account for a full of global economic activity another source ecommercetimes com recently reported that the scope of this business is so enormous that some have even claimed that it is the single most important factor in the growth of e commerce the online gaming industry in other words appears to be booming and it may be an ideal time to is time to invest we decided to find out who the key players were in the business after speaking with a number of industry insiders the trail led us to an emerging publicly traded company called gaming transactions inc ggts after a close look at ggts we decided that this company could produce huge returns on investment in the upcoming months although ggts is a new company it has some surprisingly experienced players at the helm an uncommon thing to find in an industry only ten years old the company has come out with online versions of the addictive game keno and its management team was smart enough to secure the rights to the keno com website which if youre marketing keno is as good as it gets keno has the widest spread for the house of any mainstream gambling game ggts is also about to launch a suite of other online gambling games including poker and sports book betting once it offers these popular games and given that it already has keno com online the company could bring in great revenues attracting a lot of attention in the investment community and driving up its stock price after a successful north american launch gaming transactions inc gtts has translated its games into chinese and is about to hit asia this initiative looks like a wise business decision many analysis anticipate that china will be the biggest source of online gambling revenue by so the company could be poised for massive expansion in terms of both profits and global reach what does all this tell us a brand new company a popular well known game one of the biggest spreads for the house a growing market experienced management and a stock price that is trading under a dollar it adds up to the potential for huge gains for early investors if

internet success through simplicity every day of the week i get questions from people all over the world including my no bs gimg members wanting to know some of the most valuable secrets to my on going internet success let me say above all else i don t believe there are any true secrets to success on the net what you do to become successful in the online world is not a secret in my opinion most successful people follow simple clear repeatedly proven strategies to succeed whether on the net or off but when it comes to someone asking for advice consultation or simply asking what s your secret i have to blush say persistence and personality of course i always follow the advice with my own little disclaimer what makes me successful may not work the same for you your first lesson is to get over the deep seeded idea that success of any kind in my opinion is somehow an unknown unattainable secret clearly it is not it s not unknown it s not unattainable it s not years of digging to find the secrets to internet riches one thing that gets to me so often in my work as an internet consultant author and internet success strategist is that so many people on the net seem to have this incredibly huge mental block that stands between themselves and success on the net it s almost as if they ve been barraged by so many claims of what works and what doesn t work and so many long complicated routes to actually succeeding in their online venture that success is the equivelant of a foot high brick wall it s not that difficult my friends it is not that complicated long time friend and business associate rick beneteau has a new ebook out called branding you breaking the bank get it http www roibot com bybb cgi im bybtb but the reason i mention this is the fact that he talks so dynamically about the true simplicity of making your online venture a success and yes rick i come from the same school of self marketing marketing you obviously that s the core of his excellent new ebook and i couldn t agree with him more point being you are everything you do online to succeed you are your web site your business your marketing piece your customer service your customers experiences with your business all of it is you read his ebook you ll see more of what i m saying the matter at hand is that brick wall you might have standing high as you can see blocking the path between you internet success listen to me it is not real ok it doesn t exist there s nothing there to fear to begin with get over it what i m telling you is the only thing standing between you and the success you most desire is yourself when you realize this you will tear down that brick wall by means of complete and instantaneous disintegration it will no longer exist in your mind which is the only real place it ever was anyhow yes persistence and personality inherently includes honesty integrity accountability and many other qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate goals and realize that probably the most valuable powerful key to your success is you that may be the most incredible secret we ever uncover in our lifetime and trust me that brick wall won t ever get in your way again unless you let it talk about simple bryan is a veteran internet consultant author internet success strategist marketer he publishes mega success com chronicles to over

otc gdvi the momentum continues gdvi website debute otc bbalert gdvi news update global diversified industries debutes brand new website www gdvi net otc bb alert spectacular operating results momentum continues sales projections for next months surpasses million revenue increase net income increase stockholders equity increase increase in assets million order backlog million manufacturing capacity overview global diversified industries operates in the modular building construction industry and strategically targets the california education sector gdvi is strategically located in central california on acres with a square foot state of the art manufacturing facility throughout and the company focused on building its infrastructure through acquisitions development of a state of the art manufacturing facility and by securing the requisite financing facilities to fuel business growth through the combination of its new facility million capacity the increased demand for portable buildings and the state of california s bond approvals gdvi has become well positioned to become one of the dominant leaders in modular manufacturing on the west coast gdvi should benefit greatly from the billion school improvement bond that is expected to be passed by california voters next month march this presents in our opinion an opportunity for early investors of gdvi to also benefit before the mainstream investor realizes who the benefactors are and subsequently invests in those companies global diversified has taken numerous strategic development steps throughout and including generating strong revenues as well as profits and is now poised for explosive growth in the company is led by a strong management team with previous success in building companies into million per annum businesses in the past year gdvi has exceeded its own sales revenue projections renewed its piggyback contract received state approvals on engineered product designs started a new credit facility and opened its new square foot manufacturing facility the company will continue to seek new acquisition candidates through its aggressive growth plan profile gdvi is a holding company that currently operates two wholly owned subsidiaries mbs construction inc a modular contractor specializing in modular construction site work and renovation and global modular inc a sales marketing and manufacturing of modular type structures its principal customer base is currently educational public and private schools universities etc child care and municipality sectors its product lines consist of a variety of portable classroom designs including both single story and two story floor plans global modular s portable classroom structures are engineered and constructed in accordance with pre approved building plans commonly referred to as p c s or pre checked plans that conform to structural and seismic safety specifications administered by the california department of state architects dsa global modular also enjoys the benefit of providing educational customers with products contracted under a piggyback clause the state of california allows school districts to canvass proposals from modular classroom vendors under a bidding process where the successful bidder can provide other public school districts and municipalities portable classrooms under a piggyback contract issued by the originating school district this process saves school districts valuable time and resources from the necessity of soliciting bids a modular vendor who possesses a piggyback contract containing competitive pricing and a variety of design options may have access to future business for up to five years depending on the term of the piggyback contract the strategic focus on california schools since california legislation has required that at least of all new classrooms constructed with state funds be portable structures there are five compelling reasons for this trend modular classrooms are faster to construct as quickly as weeks they cost significantly less as low as vs they offer greater flexibility for use compared to conventional buildings they are easier to finance they provide financing incentives to cope with population growth the state department of education estimates that california will need more than classrooms each year for the next four years which equates to more than classrooms due to the current and projected budget cuts throughout the california education sector public and private schools are expected to turn to portable modular construction to fulfill their additional classroom requirements over the next four years the california schools budget crisis on november a billion school facilities improvements bond proposal proposition was passed by california voters this bond measure passage does not include an approximate billion worth of local bond measures passed by various school districts throughout the state a second bond measure worth billion went before the voters on the march these bond measures are about three times higher than the record billion bond california voters approved in the revenue generated from these bond measures will be used for school modernization programs which include requirements for relocatable classrooms and modular classroom construction and renovations money from the bonds will help overcrowded public and private schools design upgrades and expand building space at community colleges and other institutions of higher learning throughout california gdvi business infrastructure among global

x bcc industry giants can t match this opportunity another ground breaking news alert from rlyc the potential stored value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately million people of which only about million now maintain active stored value debit card accounts one company is quickly entering a trillion market space with a proposed portfolio of product and service offerings that even the largest multi national corporations in its industry may have a hard time matching in just a few months this company has begun adding and developing innovative new products and targeting acquisitions that could help it reach millions of new long term customers that could generate tremendous re occurring revenues for many years to come although you have probably never heard of this company you may soon hear of it even if you don t continue reading this message that s because it is making a major push to put its products in the hands of a half million people in the u s within the next year an upstart company to make a real impact in a two trillion dollar industry in reality this company s lack of early recognition could be a major plus for you since the overwhelming majority of investors and institutions don t know this company or what they plan to accomplish their stock is trading at rock bottom prices but if they do accomplish even a small part of what they have set out to do over the coming months and years this company could become a significant player in its trillion dollar industry and its stock reflect its accomplishments the company that we ll introduce you to today is relay capital corp pink sheets rlyc rlyc which recently went public is a multi faceted financial services company that focuses primarily on the stored value card market rlyc s present product and service offerings include pre paid stored value cards reward cards employee payroll cards gift retail and affinity group cards travel cards and funds transfer cards these services are aimed at a significant market both domestically and internationally just because a company is in a large and growing industry doesn t necessarily ensure that it will be a winner in order to be successful that company also needs to be truly innovative have very strong partners be able to reach vast customer bases and have a management team capable of putting it all together and turning its goals into reality rlyc appears to be that company below we ll discuss this substantial potential market rlyc is after and what sets rlyc apart from the competition the potential stored value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately million people of which only about million now maintain active stored value debit card accounts stored value cards have the potential to help the million adults and their families who have been excluded from the e commerce revolution because they do not have access to credit or banking facilities the implications reverberate across industry segments estimates suggest stored value transactions could exceed trillion in just a few years rlyc s focus is on providing stored value cards to the un banked and under banked these terms refer to consumers that that do not have a bank account debit card the size of that group is staggering that s about one third of the nation s work force rlyc capitalizes on the dilemma these consumers face by providing stored value card programs that make it easy fast and secure for people and businesses to buy all manners of goods and services using stored value cards as well as for the un banked and under banked to be paid their salaries via the same cards but that s not all the benefits relay will offer on its stored value cards as well as other financial services will also be of great benefit to those who already have banking relationships in this segment relay plans to offer more services with greater convenience for less cost to the consumer who wouldn t want that the payroll market is another enormous market for rlyc for the under and un banked collecting their pay cashing payroll checks and then paying bills with those funds can be extremely complicated and time consuming rlyc s stored value pay transfer card program presents a very effective and innovative solution for this problem rlyc s pay transfer card program can lower costs to employers to process payroll for the banked and the un banked alike lower costs to cardholders to potentially transfer cash between u s cards cards in foreign countries and services bought through the cards improved employee retention improved customer retention will all be available thanks to rlyc various programs will make life much easier for cardholders using the system while also providing the convenience and flexibility of either visa or mastercard purchasing power or hour access to their money through atms rlyc signs loi with national staffing company to use its pay transfer cards earlier this year rlyc signed a binding letter of intent to provide a pay transfer card program for asgard global resources llc click to go to their site a leader in providing technical craft and administrative staffing services to businesses industry and government through locations in houston dallas long island orlando phoenix and southern california all areas with huge un and under banked populations the potential market for this service is really big it includes large employers companies that process payroll and financial institutions that provide banking and payroll services to commercial customers this system will simplify payments to widely dispersed employees and contractors while dramatically decreasing payroll distribution by offering a cost effective alternative to printing cutting and mailing paper payroll checks it also helps to reduce a great deal of paper processing of checks and pay eliminate lost checks stop payments and minimize fraud but best of all this should help to significantly boost rlyc s revenues billion sent worldwide by relatives to home countries mexicans in u s send billion a year back to mexico with billion being transferred internationally each year remittances are a really big business in times past people wanting to send money to relatives back in their home countries had few choices many times their only choice was an expensive proposition like western union more recently more and more people have resorted to purchasing and mailing money orders in order to try to cut down on the cost of sending remittances the problems with traditional money transfer methods with wire services there are any number of inherent problems when trying to send money to relatives overseas first wiring funds across borders can be expensive this can make it very cost prohibitive to send smaller amounts of cash and often means that relatives must wait longer to receive their remittances because the sender has to save up until the amount is large enough to warrant the cost associated with the wire service next there is the problem of logistics both the sender and the recipient must be able to easily reach a storefront that offers the same wire company s services even if they both are able to do this the recipient may have to make multiple trips to the wire service office to check to see if their funds have cleared yet and can be released to them lastly the sender and the recipient are subjected to varying service fees depending on which wire service they choose these fees can be very high and can significantly cut into the amount of money the recipient ultimately receives so even though using a wire service may be a fairly fast way to transfer money it can be very expensive and logistically difficult to use with money orders there is always the problem of mail service although in america we have grown accustomed to relatively quick and reliable mail service this is not always the case in foreign countries this is especially true in underdeveloped nations where most remittances are sent a letter containing a remittance that a family is depending on to provide much needed food and shelter could take many days or even weeks to arrive and there is always the chance that it will never arrive at its destination at all meaning that the sender s family could go hungry or end up on the streets what is the best way to send remittances by far the most convenient fast safe and ultimately cost efficient method to send remittances is through a stored value card with this type of service a person can easily activate a card and then just deposit funds into the account onto the card via loading station telephone or the internet for easy use by relatives in his or her home country the process is extremely easy and cost effective funds can be added to the card s account at an ever increasing number of convenient locations the family member overseas can then draw down on those funds by presenting a card from that account to make purchases or they can use the card to withdraw cash from atms it could not be any simpler rlyc has already begun filling orders in june of this year rlyc announced that it had received its first order for pin based stored value cards the company stated that its growth estimates call for approximately new stored value cards being put into circulation each month this could result in exponential revenue growth as new customers are added and its customers take advantage of its other financial services moreover though other programs it is working on it could have one half million cards in the market within the next months rlyc plans to expand its services through partner companies and one stop financial centers rlyc expects to fuel exponential growth of recurring revenue from individual card usage monthly fees as well as other activities occurring at its loading centers or the virtual financial centers it is planning loading centers are retail locations such as convenience stores check cashing facilities or other types of retail facilities serving to dispense or receive cash facilitating transactions for the debit card consumer rlyc has already established strategic relationships with

capital hill gold chgi potential high grade gold deposit breaking news denver june business wire capital hill gold inc chgi reports that the company s geologists are evaluating a potential high grade bulk tonnage gold deposit located in mineral county nevada the project is situated in the vicinity of several operating and past producing gold mines including the paradise peak santa fe and rawhide deposits after review of usgs geochemical survey work of the project and a study of the geology of other gold deposits in the area geologists believe that the target would be a high grade bulk tonnage gold deposit virgin deposits the privately held acre project was originally staked by a major gold mining company in the s the property has never been drilled and may prove to be a rich vein as early tests have indicated follow up work by the company s geologist indicated that a major international gold mining company had staked approximately unpatented lode mining claims in the area during and geologists investigating the property for capital hill observed multiple broad zones of silicification extending for considerable distances samples were collected from several outcrops on the property and have been submitted to american assay labs in elko nevada for assaying based on positive assay results target and identification a major claim staking program will be launched accordingly as further credible evidence emerges of a significant gold ore deposit and the first results coming in are showing promise on june the company announced in a press release that capital hill s management is pleased and encouraged with the first u o uranium oxide assay returns as well as the noticeable precious metal results and that initial reconnaissance sampling on the company s uranium project has returned assays grading u o to u o of great interest to the company is the fact that the samples taken also assayed positively for precious metals with results ranging from to oz ag st and trace amounts of gold the occurrence of silver in conjunction with the uranium mineralization warrants further investigation the recent news of the company possibly sitting on a huge untapped gold deposit has the stock in a strong up trend rallying from cents to cents during the past three months as the three month chart illustrates trading volume has swelled to shares per day with money flow indicators showing strong inflows which is representative of a stock that is under accumulation the positive tape action clearly shows strong investor sentiment about the company s leverage on controlling sizable parcels of gold fields the potential recoverable gold data has yet to be compiled but as mentioned above early tests are very promising which is why investors are bidding up shares ahead of this data capital hill gold s strategic objective is to obtain controlling interests in properties with excellent exploration potential to become economically significant to world class ore deposits chgi intends to acquire mineral exploration properties primarily through the filing of concessions on its own account and in partnership as well as by optioning exceptional properties at reasonable costs relative to the property s potential and the financial capabilities of the company in recent weeks chgi shareholders have been on the receiving end of some very promising developments with the new discoveries for gold ore in addition the company is aggressively exploring for commercial grade uranium deposits that will supply newly heightened demand from nuclear utilities since uranium prices have doubled of the world s electricity comes from uranium and the nuclear power plant count is stable and growing the united states needs to add about nuclear power plants over the next two decades to meet burgeoning demand for electric power and maintain the current generating mix nils j diaz chairman of the u s nuclear regulatory commission told reporters in early may as of may the company is pleased to report that the claim staking crew and geologist have arrived on site and have begun staking claims the area being staked encompasses a large area of potentially commercial grade uranium mineralization identified by previous work including geophysical surveys reconnaissance sampling of the ground being staked has returned assay results approximately equal to those of in place resources at one of the past producing uranium mines in the project area a chinese news web site reports that china the world s second largest energy consumer after the u s will spend billion yuan u s billion on building new nuclear power plants by this is a bigger number than we have seen in the past the energy hungry country intends to increase the amount of installed nuclear power capacity from the current gigawatts to gigawatts within years nuclear power generation is expected to triple to reach gigawatts by that time so the market for uranium is in a new bull market conclusion development efforts for gold and uranium on chgi properties are about to commence following the better than expected geophysical testing results shares of chgi have rallied over fold in just the past three months in anticipation of what the future holds in the way of extractible gold and uranium once full mining operations are under way it is our view that the shares will rally as

attics crawl spaces etc than lecture on fast and loose applications of code something about cents a bd ft installed meeting all codes and spray applied many companies we talk to have a product that appears to be perfect but they haven t spent the money to test over foam maybe a small committee could do a evaluation of various products report results to spfa who in turn will acquire funding from us william b australia we are in australia but we are finding it hard to locate polyurea sprayers here so that we can start a chapter of the pda do u have any list of australian contractors suppliers or maybe they can put their hand up and lets us know at enviroline powerup com au it isfor the betterof the game that an association is need to inform clients and specifiers of the uses and properties of polyureas and train its own members also to keep cowboys out that give the industry a bad name ed m i am a writer for aviation magazines and one that i write for is a test international a new publication that just launched this month i need any new processes you might have that would be used on aircraft particularly commercial aviation john c louisiana i have a foam cat graco machine and a probler gun with a tip i use this setup to spray truck bed liners my question is can i and how do i spray foam insulation using my equipment and what are the different types of insulation murph mahaffey glas craft i like the new look of the industry forum mark w south carolina i m sick of all this garbage about covering foam with a thermal barrier what the hell do you think foam is if you are saying that anything that can be forced to burn should be covered with a fireproof barrier then you d better get busy covering all those trusses and joists and plywood up there that are definitely not carrying a class one fire rating this double standard for foam is coming directly from those who stand to lose business from it icynene is different it doesn t burn alone it doesn t melt it doesn t emit phosgene does it smoke in a fire situation sure so what blaming foam in the attic for a house fire because it forces the foam to eventually burn is about as stupid as blaming foam seat cushions for burning when a gas tank ruptures and burns up a car get real inspectors you want us to cover up the only thing in the attic assembly that doesn t burn as for the vaunted r rating system it is totally bogus the test is designed to make porous insulations appear to perform better than they actually do measuring only conduction and ignoring convection and radiant to convective transfer the test should have been thrown out for the industry lackey it is years ago along with that obsolete fiberglassgarbage they re still selling everybody there s a reason they don t make refrigerators freezers coolers coffee cups out of fiberglass or cellulose think about it dirk benthien forum moderator thank you mark and dik for your statements above i also feel that far too often individuals and

out of b brian d canada there has been a lot of talk about ceramic coatings we are a distributor of such a coating we have never professed an r reason is there isn t an astm test available to measure

completely legal just read the next few paragraphs and see what you think if you like what you read great if you don t read it again because you must have missed something as seen on national television making over a half million dollars every months from your home for an investment of only us dollars expense one time thanks to the computer age and the internet be a millionaire like others within a year before you say no way read the following this is the letter you ve been reading about in the news lately due to the popularity of this letter on the internet a major nightly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of the program described below to see if it really can make people money the show also investigated whether or not the program was legal their findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in this program this has helped to show people that this is a simple harmless and fun way to make some extra money at home and besides even if you never got involved in the program the reports themselves are well worth the money they can help you start and advertise any business on the internet that is these reports stand alone and are beneficial to anyone wishing to do business on the internet the results of this show have been truly remarkable so many people are participating that those involved are doing much better than ever before since everyone makes more as more people try it out its been very exciting to be a part of it lately you will understand once you experience it here it is below print this now for future reference the following income opportunity is one you may be interested in taking a look at it can be started with very little investment and the income return is tremendous this is a legitimate legal money making opportunity it does not require you to come into contact with people do any hard work and best of all you never have to leave your house except to get the mail simply follow the instructions and you really can make this happen this e mail order marketing program works every time if you put in the effort to make it work e mail is the sales tool of the future take advantage of this non commercialized method of advertising now the longer you wait the more savvy people will be taking your business using e mail get what is rightfully yours program yourself for success and dare to think big it sounds corny but it s true you ll never make it big if you don t have this belief system in place multi level marketing mlm has finally gained respectability it is being taught in the harvard business school and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between and of all goods and services will be sold through multi level methods this is a multi billion dollar industry and of the millionaires in the u s made their fortune in the last several years in mlm moreover statistics show people become millionaires everyday through multi level marketing you may have heard this story before but donald trump made an appearance on the david letterman show dave asked him what he would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch without hesitating trump said he would find a good network marketing company and get to work the audience started to hoot and boo him he looked out at the audience and dead panned his response that s why i m sitting up here and you are all sitting out there with network marketing you have two sources of income direct commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you introduce to the business residual income is the secret of the wealthy it means investing time and money once and getting paid again and again and again in network marketing it also means getting paid for the work of others the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers fortunately sometime later i reread everything and gave some thought and study to it my name is jonathan rourke two years ago the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down sized and my position was eliminated after unproductive job interviews i decided to open my own business over the past year i incurred many unforeseen financial problems i owed my family friends and creditors over the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just couldn t seem to make ends meet i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business at that moment something significant happened in my life and i am writing to share that experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially in mid december i received this program via e mail six month s prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities all of the programs i received in my opinion were not cost effective they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year it didn t tell me i d have to write a book to make it but like i was saying in december i received this program i didn t send for it or ask for it they just got my name off a mailing list thank goodness for that after reading it several times to make sure i was reading it correctly i couldn t believe my eyes here was a money making phenomenon i could invest as much as i wanted to start without putting me further into debt after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out i would at least get my money back but like most of you i was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all so i checked it out with the u s post office hrs and they confirmed that it is indeed legal after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter i decided why not initially i sent out e mails it cost me about for my time on line the great thing about e mail is that i don t need any money for printing to send out the program and because all of my orders are filled via e mail the only expense is my time i am telling you like it is i hope it doesn t turn you off but i promised myself that i would not rip off anyone no matter how much money it cost me here is the basic version of what you need to do your first goal is to receive at least orders for report within weeks of your first program going out if you don t send out more programs until you do your second goal is to receive at least orders for report within weeks if not send out more programs until you do once you have your orders relax you ve met your goal you will make but keep at it if you don t get right off keep at it it may take some time for your down line to build keep at it stay focused and do not let yourself get distracted in less than one week i was starting to receive orders for report i kept at it kept mailing out the program and by january had received orders for report my first step in making in days was done by january had received orders for report more than i needed so i sat back and relaxed by march of my e mailing of i received with more coming in every day i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car please take time to read the attached program it will change your life forever remember it won t work if you don t try it this program does work but you must follow it exactly especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place it won t work you ll lose out on a lot of money in order for this program to work very fast try to meet your goal of orders for report and orders for report and you will make or more in days if you don t reach the first two goals with in four weeks relax you will still make a ton of money it may take a few months or so longer but keep mailing out the programs and stay focused that s the key i am living proof that it works if you choose not to participate in this program i am sorry it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you if you choose to participate follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security if you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble like i was or you want to start your own business consider this a sign i did sincerely jonathan rourke p s do you have any idea what bills look like piled up on a kitchen table it s awesome a personal note from the originator of this program by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports you should have concluded that such a program and one that is legal could not have been created by an amateur let me tell you a little about myself i had a profitable business for years then in my business began falling off i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me but it wasn t working finally i figured it out it wasn t me it was the economy inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since i don t have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate because many of you know from first hand experience there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before the middle class was vanishing those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up those who did not including those who never had anything to save or invest were moving down into the ranks of the poor as the saying goes the rich get richer and the poor get poorer the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to move up or get rich inflation will see to that you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life with no risk and just a little bit of effort you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined follow the program exactly as instructed do not change it in any way it works exceedingly well as it is now remember to e mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of one of the people you send this to may send out and your name will be on everyone of them remember though the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach so my friend i have given you the ideas information materials and opportunity to become financially independent it is up to you now think about it before you delete this program from your mailbox as i almost did take a little time to read it and really think about it get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it you will still make a lot of money you will definitely

of raising capital really works every time i am sure that you could use up to or more in the next days before you say no way please read this program carefully this is not a chain letter but a perfectly legal money making opportunity basically this is what you do as with all multilevel businesses we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multilevel business partners and we offer a product for every dollar sent your orders come by mail and are filled by e mail so you are not involved in personal selling you do it privately in your own home store or office this is the greatest multi level mail order marketing anywhere this is what you must do order all reports shown on the list below you can t sell them if you don t have them for each report send cash the name number of the report you are ordering your e mail address and your name return address in case of a problem make sure your return address is on your envelope in case of any mail problems when you place your order make sure you order each of the five reports you need all five reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them within a few days you will receive via e mail each of the five reports save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the s of people who will order them from you important do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report or their order on the list in any way other than as instructed below in steps a through g or you will lose out on the majority of your profits once you understand the way this works you ll also see how it doesn t work if you change it remember this method has been tested and if you alter it it will not work a look below for the listing of available reports b after you ve ordered the five reports take this advertisement and remove the name and address under report this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their c move the name and address under report down to report d move the name and address under report down to report e move the name and address under report down to report f move the name and address under report down to report g insert your name and address in the report position please make sure you copy every name and address accurately copy and paste method works well take

surely you can afford you obviously already have an internet connection and e mail is free to assist you with marketing your business on the internet the reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e mails where to find thousands of free classified ads and much much more here are two primary methods of building your downline method sending bulk e mail let s say that you decide to start small just to see how it goes and we ll assume you and all those involved send out only programs each let s also assume that the mailing receives a response using a good list the response could be much better also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of but continuing with this example you send out only programs with a response that is only orders for report those people respond by sending out programs each for a total of out of those people respond and order report those mail out programs each for a total of the response to that is orders for report those send out programs each for a total the response to that is i orders for report that amounts to each of bills for you in cash money then think about level five that s alone your total income in this example is for a total of remember friend this is assuming out of the people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half sent out programs instead of believe me many people will do just that and more report will show you the best methods for bulk e mailing and e mail software method placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise let s say you decide to start small just to see how well it works assume your goal is to get only people to participate on your first level placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response also assume that everyone else in your organization gets only downline members follow this example to achieve the staggering results below lst level your members with nd level members from those x rd level members from those x th level members from those x k th level members from those x k this totals remember friends this assumes that the people who participate only recruit people each think for a moment what would happen if they got people to participate most people get s of participants think about it for every you receive all you must do is e mail them the report they ordered that s it always provide same day service on all orders this will guarantee that the e mail they send out with your name and address on it will be prompt because they can t advertise until they receive the report available reports order each report by number and name always send cash u s currency for each report checks not accepted always send your order via first class mail make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets of paper so that the bill can t be seen against light on one of those sheets of paper include a the number name of the report you are ordering b your e mail address and c your name postal

a better investment than the stock market all our mailings are sent complying to the proposed h r unsolicited commercial electronic mail act of please see the bottom of this message for further information and removal instructions parents of year old find cash hidden in his closet does this headline look familiar of course it does you most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program usa and reported elsewhere in the world including my neck of the woods new zealand his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her year old sons closet nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash five dollar bills twenties fifties and hundreds all neatly rubber banded in labelled piles my first thought was that he had robbed a bank says the year old woman there was over dollars in that bag that s more than my husband earns in a year the woman immediately called her husband at the car dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered he came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet as it turns out the boy had been sending out via e mail a type of report to e mail addresses that he obtained off the internet everyday after school for the past months he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom i just got the e mail one day and i figured what the heck i put my name on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out says the clever year old the e mail letter listed addresses and contained instructions to send one dollar bill to each person on the list then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses down and finally to add your name to the top of the list the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five dollar bills within weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the address list i get junk e mail all the time and really did not think it was going to work the boy continues within the first few days of sending out the e mail the post office box that his parents had gotten him for his video game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines but envelopes containing bills about a week later i rode my bike down to the post office and my box had magazine and about envelops stuffed in it there was also a yellow slip that said i had to go up to the post office counter i thought i was in trouble or something laughs he goes on i went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me i had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all over the next few weeks the boy continued sending out the e mail the money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet barely had time for my homework he had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the bills for twenties fifties and hundreds i didn t want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack i would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me one time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it but i just rode to the next bank down the street laughs surprisingly the boy did not have any reason to be afraid the reporting news team examined and investigated the so called chain letter the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain letter at all in fact it was completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws title section and or title section in the us code also in the code of federal regulations volume sections and which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received every five dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read please send me report number xyx this simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service a report on how to for a five dollar fee this is the end of the media release if you would like to understand how the system works and get your please continue reading what appears below is what the year old was sending out on the net you can use it too just follow the simple instructions be financially free like others within a year before you say bull please read the following this is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately due to the popularity of this letter on the internet a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below to see if it really can make people money the show also investigated whether or not the program was legal their findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple instructions they are bound to make some megabucks with only out of pocket cost due to the recent increase of popularity respect this program has attained it is currently working better than ever note follow the directons below i had best results the second time when i hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions in order for all of us to be successful many many emails must be sent so that the returns are many i have been extremely successful using the following company they send out the offers and all i do is accept money for reports then i send back to the people as soon as possible this is what one had to say thanks to this profitable opportunity i was approached many times before but each time i passed on it i am so glad i finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required to my astonishment i received total in weeks with money still coming in pam hedland fort lee new jersey here is another testimonial this program has been around for a long time but i never believed in it but one day when i received this again in the mail i decided to gamble my on it i followed the simple instructions and walaa weeks later the money started to come in first month i only made but the next months after that i made a total of so far in the past months by re entering the program i have made over and i am playing it again the key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and not change anything more testimonials later but first print this now for your future reference order all reports shown on the list below for each report send cash the name number of the report you are ordering and your e mail address to the person whose name appears on

profits once you understand the way this works you will also see how it does not work if you change it remember this method has been tested and if you alter it will not work people have tried to put their friends relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money but it does not work this way believe us we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened so do not try to change anything other than what is instructed because if you do it will not work for you remember honesty reaps the reward after you have ordered all reports take this advertisement and remove the name address of the person in report this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune move the name address in report down to report move the name address in report

assist you with marketing your business on the internet the reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e mails legally where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more there are primary methods to get this venture going method by sending bulk e mail legally let s say that you decide to start small just to see how it goes and we will assume you and those involved send out only e mails each let s also assume that the mailing receive only a response the response could be much better but lets just say it is only also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e mails instead of only each continuing with this example you send out only e mails with a response that is only orders for report those people responded by sending out e mail each for a total of out of those e mails only responded with orders that equals people responded and ordered report those people mail out e mails each for a total of e

think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one th of those people mailed e mails each or more there are over million people on the internet worldwide and counting believe me many people will do just that and more method by placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise placing a lot of free

make pretty good money when i received this program i grumbled to jody about receiving junk mail i made fun of the whole thing spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved i knew it wouldn t work jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet i made merciless fun of her and was ready to lay the old i told you so on her when the thing didn t work well the laugh was on me within weeks she had received responses within the next days she had received total all cash i was shocked i have joined jody in her hobby mitchell wolf chicago illinois not being the gambling type it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan but conservative that i am i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i wouldn t get enough orders to at least get my money back i was surprised when i found my medium size post office box crammed with orders i made in the first weeks the nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live there simply isn t a better investment with a faster return and so big dan sondstrom alberta canada i had received this program before i deleted it but later i wondered if i should have given it a try of course i had no idea who to contact to get another copy so i had to wait until i was e mailed again by someone else months

breaking biotech news genethera inc to collaborate with biotech giant beckman coulter inc genethera news release july th genethera inc otc bb gtha a molecular biotech company located in wheat ridge co granted first right of refusal to beckman coulter inc nyc bec to license genethera s patented technology for developing live animal genetic diagnostic tests this is a significant milestone for genethera beckman coulter is one of the world s leading manufacturers of biomedical testing systems tests and supplies our collaboration will unite the expertise of beckman coulter with the cutting edge technology of genethera dr antonio milici m d ph d genethera inc genethera provides genetic diagnostic solutions for the veterinary and agricultural industries with future plans to include the healthcare industry the company was formed to realize the commercial potential of molecular diagnostic assays using roche s f pcr technology to detect the presence of infectious disease from the blood of animals particularly live animals this platform enables genethera to offer tests that are presently not available from any other technology future plans include all infectious disease potentially affecting domesticated livestock as well as wildlife intended for human consumption with priority being given to mad cow johne s and foot and mouth diseases in cattle genethera has successfully

kits and services for more information visit www beckmancoulter com we are looking forward to working with genethera to identify commercial applications of their technology chris neary general manager prion business center beckman coulter inc in most countries around the globe the discovery of a cow with mad cow disease leads to the immediate slaughter of hundreds even thousands of cattle out of wide spread fear of disease spread and the need to complete disease testing on the dead animals costly international beef recalls are common since mad cow testing until now has only been conducted after the slaughter process genethera s live animal blood test could lead to halting of mass slaughters and widespread panic while saving the industry hundreds of millions of dollars each year through the testing of a single blood sample genethera could end the need to slaughter entire herds of cattle and other animals for disease testing saving the industry hundreds of millions of dollars each year currently funded by an institutional money manager in southern california genethera has plans to open laboratories worldwide to meet this exploding bse testing demand you want to invest in the

genethera technology genethera s business is based on its integrated technology platform itp that combines a proprietary diagnostic solution called gene expression assay gea tm with purivax tm its system for analyzing large scale dna sequencing the first part of this platform is the ongoing development of molecular diagnostic assays solutions using real time fluorogenic polymerase chain reaction f pcr technology to detect the presence of infectious disease from the blood of live animals the second part of the itp is the development of therapeutic vaccines using rna interference technology it also allows for the efficient effective and continuous testing management and treatment of animal populations these facts distinguish the technology from any alternative testing and management methodology available to agriculture today all of which require the destruction of individual animals and even entire herds our testing and data analysis processes also allow us not only to separate infected from clean animals but also to gain knowledge vital to development of preventative vaccines genethera inc is committed to providing global access to cutting edge biotechnology services to fellow scientists in academia the pharmaceutical industry and the biotechnology industry primarily genethera s expertise focuses on technology relevant to animal and human immunotherapy

vaccines for such blood born diseases it also allows for the efficient effective and continuous testing management and treatment of animal populations these facts distinguish the technology from any alternative testing and management methodology available to agriculture today all of which require the destruction of individual animals and even entire herds our testing and data analysis processes also allow us not only to separate infected from clean animals but also to gain knowledge vital to development of preventative vaccines to date genethera has successfully developed the assay ability to detect mad cow and chronic wasting disease a disease affecting elk and deer in north america diagnostic assays for e coli ol h and johnne s disease are in the final stages of development vaccines for e coli ol h and johnne s disease both of which are diseases affecting cattle are in advanced stages of development in the future the company plans to expand assay application research to a wide range of diseases animals the immediate targets being mad cow hoof mouth west nile and newcastle genethera can detect bse using the companies patented live animal blood test that evaluates the e d r f gene sequence the e d r f gene is proven to decrease dramatically before any tse infection is noticeable in a live animal or human the patent gtha holds is broad based and can detect all tse diseases including mad cow bse in cattle cwd in elk deer and creutzfeld jacobs in humans the company s patented test can detect these diseases faster than any other method developed in the marketplace and at far less a cost the test can also be used on a mass scale using roche f pcr dna analyzing robotics equipment genethera can analyze over blood samples a day with one f pcr machine and a single technician the project will prove highly profitable at approx per test when wide scale commercialization is under way a multi billion dollar international demand for commercial mad cow testing has emerged around the globe japan conducted million post mortem rapid mad cow tests last year alone they used the western blot developed by prionics ag in swizterland and bio rad s rapid test costs are between and dollars per test most importantly other tests in the marketplace cannot detect the disease until the animal has been killed testing through post mortem brain tissue exams is extremely labor intensive and costly japan spent between million million on million post mortem rapid mad cow tests in genethera s simple blood test can be collected using their patented field collection system the sample is then mailed to the lab for testing the company also stated in their recent k that they are currently in negotiations with strategic testing partners that we believe will absorb the costs

wirelessly track their assets and resources such technology has huge potential in the protection and transportation of materials designated high risk were they to fall into the wrong hands vnbl works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in order to create high security space in locales where it is deemed necessary locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports sea

a holding company seeking to identify long term growth opportunities in the areas of homeland security security information systems and other security services announced today that it plans to offer products and services that will assist in the automation of the identification and control of equipment assets tools and the related processes used in the oil gas and petrochemical industries although small wirelessly networked rfid sensors can monitor machines and equipment to detect possible problems before they become serious they can also deliver safety features within oil wells oil maybe trapped in different layers of rock along with gas and water detection of specific liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur such as a well filling with water as with other rf based technology applications rfid can also provide the safe transit of materials by only the authorized handler and limit the entry of personnel to specific locations ensuring personnel safety is essential should there be an emergency at a facility rfid tags would enable the customer to track and evaluate its employee s safety and or danger this application technology requires product and hardware that can operate in harsh and potentially hazardous conditions but gives valuable safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer rfid can also assist the customer s supply chain by tracking oil gas and chemical products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retail level vinoble s viewpoint as previously stated is that these applications are more than just a valuable tool to the mining industry but as a protective measure of our country s natural resources and commodities against threat preservation of these fuels and resources is important to the safety of u s industry and economy the company believes that such offering service and technology application in the oil gas and petrochemical industry will further position vinoble in a rapidly expanding industry while taking advantage of access to the increasing capital and global spending that the company will require for

reduction in road accidents august dear sir madam in case you have received this mail earlier kindly ignore this mail it may have been re sent to you by mistake ours is not a mailing list and we have no intention of sending any regular mails to anybody we have devised a set of systems which can reduce the damage caused to vehicles and deaths and injury caused to passengers and pedestrians in vehicular accidents by more than seventy five percent we have already filed and are in process of filing further multiple and appropriate disclosure documents provisional patent applications at the united states patent trademarks office uspto and also applications under the patent co operation treaty at world intellectual property organization wipo at geneva there is absolutely no doubt that our idea is new and innovative moreover we are very confident and very sure that this will help reducing minimizing human suffering to a very large extent there is no doubt that the product devised by us will change the face of the earth forever brief details relating to our product are detailed in the annexures under the following headings statistics advantages options economics we are looking for the followings business consultancy and advice regarding the most viable practical and profitable course of action under the circumstances and also consultancy on patents one person moderately injured every three seconds one person mildly injured every three seconds c current yearly automobile sales worldwide more than billion us d number of automobiles worldwide more than billion pieces e daily loss caused due to vehicular accidents worldwide more than billion us per day of the worldwide gross national product of more than billion us more than us per year more than billion us per day theadvantages of the technology developed by us a the introduction of such technology will dramatically reduce the expenses of auto insurance this reduction of insurance cost will be at par with or even more that the expenses incurred towards the introduction of such technology in modern day vehicles accordingly the life insurance premier will also undergo drastic reduction additionally because of saving of lives the outgo of the insurance companies will reduce substantially b as per the who studies and projections road accidents occupy the number nine positions by way of causes of death in the world today it is projected by who that by the year they will occupy the number three positions next only to heart disease and depression by introduction of this technology we are sure that this will not happen on the contrary there will be massive reduction in the number of deaths due to road accidents and road accidents may not figure on the list of major causes of death in the year at all c this technology will therefore make all vehicles cheaper and safer not only will the cost be reduced safety which is priceless in itself will also be greatly enhanced as and when the regular patent application is filed and patent is granted the life of the patent will be years even at the current levels with road accidents placed at number nine on the who list as a major cause of death there is a daily loss of two billion us even at the present level over a period of twenty years without any interest and without any compounding this loss works out to be billion us x days x years billion us d our technology will ensure that at least seventy five percent of the above losses are prevented such figure works out to be more that billion us it is important to note that this is the projection at the current level as per the future projections the incidents of road accidents are expected to increase hence the figure is likely to be increase very substantially in addition the time factor and the interest factor will inflate this figure further e at the current levels more than million persons are dying every year due to road accidents even at the current rates more than million lives will be lost in road accidents over the next twenty years i e life of the patent when granted besides at the current levels million people are injured every year in the next twenty years the number of people injured due to road accident will therefore be more than half a billion f if we add to that the personal physical and psychological traumas to those directly involved in and also to those who are associated with the people involved in the road accidents the trauma and the misery and henceforth the value of the savings are all unmeasurable in quantities presently known to human kind g considering the figures and dynamics as explained hereinabove it may not be improper or out of place to compare this technology with the introduction of electricity computer or aircrafts in terms of its value to mankind h the benefits of this technology will be so obvious and essential that in the very near future the use of this technology will become unavoidable it should and will become mandatory by law to install such technology and the installation of such technology should and will be a pre requisite for granting or renewal of the registration and license of all vehicles in future i as described hereinabove this technology and its utility are incomparable outthought of and unheard of till date it will open a new floodgate in human travel and safety measures in future it can and will be applied to other mode of transport like aircrafts and trains also among other things we have the following options available to us options available to us a outright sale a immediate outright sale of the idea and the concept along with our filed applications for one time lump sum consideration b further development of the concept and further filing of patent and all patent related applications before taking steps as outlined in a the process b will obviously increase the realization in terms of price b licencing options i new vehicles granting of licenses to manufacturers of automobiles individually or collectively all over the world for incorporation in the automobiles to be manufactured in future on fixed time or per piece basis ii conversion of existing vehicles to independent agents for conversion of the existing more than billion vehicles all over the world c combined options a collaborative arrangement with some private and or government agency wherein we receive a certain down payment and then jointly distribute the licensing rights on a pre decided sharing partnership arrangement the economics of the project will be as follows in case any all processes and systems described by us are incorporated in the design of new vehicles and the new vehicles are manufactured in accordance with the modified designs the cost escalation may not be more than to and the safety and the protection will be ten times more than the price escalation hence drop in insurance premier will compensate for the cost escalation in case the existing vehicles are modified the cost involved will be approximately to of the value of the vehicle but partial modifications at a lower cost which will give partial protection may also be carried out as a thumb rule the cost of modification in percentage terms will be about one fifth of the percentage of safety and protection provided in case the value of the vehicles is low or the life of the vehicle is about to expire the partial modifications may be practically and economically viable as incorporation onto a new vehicle is relatively less expensive and more protective there are more than billion motor vehicles in the world at present besides there are an unspecified number of non motorized ehicles almost all of them can be converted in phased manner to a variable degree the cost of conversion will be directly proportional to their current market value and the safety shield to be generated there from among the motorised vehicles the conversion cost may work out of few dollars for every percent of safety shield created the exact calculation can be worked out but over all some of the methods may provide more safety at lower cost compared to the other which may differ in efficiency even if we consider a very vague and approximate cost of conversion of us per vehicle the conversion industry works out to be worth billion us realising the potential of the product in terms of human safety it will be reasonable to presume that majority of such conversion will be completed over a period of three years from the starting date as pointed hereinabove the size of the conversion industry may be estimated to in the range of billion us per year over the next three years alternatively considering the diversity of available motorised vehicles all over the world conversion licensing can also be commercially viable proposition for such conversion licenses can be granted on line on receipt of on line payments in that case different rates for granting conversion to vehicles having specific registration numbers can be granted in accordance with and in proportion to the size carrying capacity and the engine power of the vehicle in case licensing is done the creation and installation of the concerned systems will be done by the end user as per his circumstances and needs however piracy is likely to be a major problem in such licensing it is likely that as and when the systems are introduced in the motorised vehicles unusual and unprecedented demand of new vehicles is created this will result in massive rejection of the vehicles currently playing all over the world and stimulate an entirely new market as far as motorised vehicle is concerned the size of such market is difficult to either comprehend and or estimate p s some of the figures have been rounded off but generally the figures are correct we have tried to keep this communication brief and to the point more details including website references are available with us and can be provided if required,1

shares wi skyrocket price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bull market in a generation natural gas prices have tripied in the last two years with multipie projects in high gear and the expanding production on reserves worth muiti miilions eogi is selling for less than the vaiue of its assets emerson oi and gas speciaiizes in using new technology to turn unproductive oi and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises already shares in the oi and gas sector are rising faster than the overa market in fact four of dow jones ten top performing industry sectors for the past year are energy reiated but it s in the mid sized expiorers and deveiopers like emerson eogi that the biggest gains are being made in the last months many of these stocks made triple and even quadrupie

dollar new markets and is expected to generate very significant recurring income with patented technology products to gain competitive advantage strategic partners are willing to integrate vspc s products on a worldwide basis future vspc cost effective growth is based on the fabless business model perfected by the semiconductor industry which for example outsources wafer manufacturing to the far east strong management team a strong management team is the most important critical ingredient to creating future shareholder value vspc has a strong management team see below large rapidly growing markets in general to increase shareholder value a company must participate in rapidly growing markets and should try to be a significant player in targeted markets vspc expects to dominate

total breakthrough with a nanotechnology based mass spectrometer is a portable carry on suitcase size device that processes identifies one molecule at a time further miniaturization is expected to

fuel cell powered portable electronic devices is expected to range between billion on the low side to billion on the high side that market does not exist today vspc s fuel cell cartridge business model is similar to the well known razor razor blade model which is to sell the razor and then make much more money on the recurring blade business the fuel cell is a razor and the disposable fuel cartridge is the razor blade another analogy is the flashlight battery model imagine if a company had the primary intellectual property involved in manufacturing flashlights it would probably license that technology to major flashlight manufacturers in return for help in dominating the recurring flashlight battery business in this case vspc has the proprietary rights to the flashlight the fuel cell and intends to sell the flashlight battery specifically disposable fuel cartridges for an end user price of each vspc is currently negotiating to provide its patented fuel cell technology to major computer manufacturers in return for their agreement to use disposable fuel cartridges developed by vspc the manufacturing of which will be outsourced to well known major plants in the far east intellectual property protected with patents vspc s fuel cell technology for example is protected by over issued and pending patents strategic partners lend credibility to create a cost effective worldwide footprint emerging companies must partner with branded global companies who have strong management teams and significant resources vspc is partnering with major well known market leaders who

global relevance by leveraging unique expertise not available elsewhere in the commercial world viaspace sees a compelling business opportunity in the homeland security public safety and fuel cell markets viaspace target markets are in excess of b yr and growing with a cagr of over in the past six years viaspace has created three companies spectrasensors qwip technologies and vialogy corp their websites provide a background on the commercialization of nasa technology spectrasensors com qwip com vialogy com the company s current focus is on three subsidiaries direct methanol fuel cell arroyo sciences and ionfinity direct liquid methanol fuel cell direct methanol fuel cell corporation dmfcc will provide disposable methanol fuel cell cartridges for tomorrow s fuel cell powered portable electronic devices such as laptop computers and cell phones methanol fuel cells dfmc are expected to replace lithium ion batteries in portable electronic devices a dfmc can power a laptop for up to hours on a disposable cartridge that costs to a smaller cartridge can power a cell phone for up to weeks we believe consumers will spend a few extra dollars for the convenience of keeping their cell phones and other electronic devices operating as a disposable product it generates recurring revenue for dmfcc the technology is protected by over issued and pending patents toshiba nec sanyo and samsung have unveiled prototype fuel cell powered products that more than double the operating time over existing battery technology dmfcc has opened a tokyo office to work closely with japanese manufacturers arroyo sciences inc arroyo focuses on the fusion of radio frequency nuclear and electromagnetic imaging to deliver information products in transportation supply chain security logistics

clean up additional projects under review projects not included in our forecast are a water purification technology and interactive radio the water purification system displays impressive statistics in that it can convert brackish sewage or industrial wastewater into ultra pure water the water system is scalable from house to municipal usage and will last years while requiring minimal maintenance the interactive radio enables a listener to receive emails or web sites delivered in response to what is broadcast the radio station essentially receives input from listeners that could enhance advertising and improve vertical market focus forecasts and valuation we expect revenues for dmfcc will be driven by increasing wireless usage of computing devices and the existing need to extend cell phone battery life we expect revenues for dmfcc will commence in and grow to million by homeland security expenditures on airport and seaport security will be a primary revenue driver for arroyo sciences which will begin to generate revenues in and will grow to million in we expect commercial revenues for ionfinity will commence in late and will be million in beyond total revenues will grow at a to rate for several years from existing and new products contracting with existing manufacturers we expect operating margins will be in the low range by our initial forecasts indicate a fair

info you requested kcc thank you for your interest judgment coursesoffers an extensive training course in how to collect moneyjudgments if you are like many people you are not even sure what a money judgment is and why processing money judgments can earn you very substantial income if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you will have a money judgment against them you are happy you won but you will soon find out the shocking fact its now up to you to collect on the judgment the court does not require the loser to pay you the court will not even help you you must trace the loser down find their assets their employment bank accounts real estate stocks and bonds etc very few people know how to find these assets or what to do when they are found the result is that millions of judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten in of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a dime the non payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic proportions right now in the united states there is between and billion dollars of uncollectedmoney judgment debt for every judgment that is paid more judgments take its place we identified this massive market years ago and have actively pursued judicial judgments since we invented this business we have perfected it into a well proven and solid profession in which only a select few will be trained in the techniques necessary to succeed with our first hand experience we have built a course which teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown and exciting field of processing money judgments by following the steps laid out in our course and with reasonable effort you can become very successful in the processing of money judgments the income potential is substantial in this profession we have associates who have taken our course and are now working full time making to over per year part time associates are earning between and per year some choose to operateout of their home and work by themselves others build a sizable organization of to people in attractive business offices today our company and our associates have over million dollars in money judgments that we are currently processing of this million million is in the form of joint ventures between our firm and our associates joint ventures are where we make our money we only break even when our course is purchased we make a margin on the reports we supply to our associates our reporting capability is so extensive that government agencies police officers attorneys credit agencies etc all come to us for reports many of our associates already have real estate liens in force of between million to over million dollars legally this means that when the properties are sold or refinanced our associate must be paid off the norm is interest compounded annually on unpaid money judgments annual interest on million at translates to annually in interest income not counting the payment of the principal our associates earn half of this amount or per year this is just for interest not counting principle and not counting the compounding of the interest which can add substantial additional income typically companies are sold for times earnings just based on simple interest an associate with million in real estate liens could sell their business for approximately million dollars of all of our associates work out of their home are women and are part time one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are not under any kind of time frame if you decide to take off for a month on vacation then go the judgments you are working on will be there when you return the judgments are still in force they do not disappear the way we train you is non confrontational you use your computer and telephone to do most of the processing you never confront the debtor the debtor doesn t know who you are you are not a collection agency simply stated the steps to successful money processing are as follows mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals with money judgments we train you how to find out who to write to to of the firms and people you write will call you and ask for your help they call you you don t call them unless you want to you send them an agreement supplied in the course to sign which splits every dollar you collect to you and to them this applies no matter if the judgment is for or you then go on line to our computers to find the debtor and their assets we offer over powerful reports to assist you they range from credit reports from all three credit bureaus to bank account locates employment locates skip traces and locating stocks and bonds etc the prices of our reports are very low typically to of what other firms charge for example we charge for an individuals credit report when some other companies charge once you find the debtor and their assets you file garnishments and liens on the assets you have located standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the course when you receive the assets you keep and send to the original judgment holder once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of judgment to the court included in the course quote s from several of our students thomas in area code writes us i just wanted to drop you a short note thanking you for your excellent course my first week part time will net me dollars your professionalism in

read an article in the economist that highlighted online gaming and how it has become a socially acceptable form of entertainment over the next few days as we thought about what sort of impact this trend could have we started to notice that online gambling was being discussed all over the media in newspapers online and on television it became obvious to us that more and more people were jumping on the internet to bet on games we also came across some staggering statistics merrill lynch for example has predicted that gambling has the potential to account for a full of global economic activity

the online gaming industry in other words appears to be booming and it may be an ideal time to is time to invest we decided to find out who the key players were in the business after speaking with a number of industry insiders the trail led us to an emerging publicly traded company called gaming transactions inc ggts after a close look at ggts we decided that this company could produce huge returns on investment in the upcoming months although ggts is a new company it has some surprisingly experienced players at the helm an uncommon thing to find in an industry only ten years old the company has come out with online versions of the addictive game keno and its management team was smart enough to secure the rights to the keno com website which if youre marketing keno is as good as it gets keno has the widest spread for the house of any mainstream gambling game ggts is also about to launch a suite of other online gambling games including poker and sports book betting once it offers these popular games and given that it already has keno com online the company could bring in great revenues attracting a lot of attention in the investment community and driving up its stock price after a successful north american launch gaming transactions inc gtts has translated its games into chinese and is about to hit asia this initiative looks like a wise business decision many analysis anticipate that china will be the biggest source of online gambling revenue by so the company could be poised for massive expansion in terms of both profits and global reach what does all this tell us a brand new company a popular well known game one of the biggest spreads for the house a growing market experienced management and a stock price that is trading under a dollar it adds up
