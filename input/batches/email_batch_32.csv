utility southern california edison sce bankruptcy deep trouble could rejected legislators legislative sources said governor much trouble gathering support plan could find anyone sponsor bill one assembly official called sce bailout plan unpopular piece legislation years analysis even deal announced agreement principle days ago seemed far fetched possible party clearly seems benefit agreement forged gov davis sce cash strapped utility california energy customers appear get short end expensive stick state seemingly gains nothing value beyond could amount whole new set administrative problems thus despite hype gov davis announced rescue plan sce california legislators republicans democrats saying fast appear collectively opposed plan currently stands becomes apparent california legislature approve plan general consensus gov davis offer sce simply financial bailout utility provides benefit california residents background details gov davis rescue plan sce please reference issuealert nutshell state california agreed buy sce mile transmission grid covers much southern half state billion times system book value sce would allowed use proceeds pay existing debt restoring financial stability california legislature cpuc need approve deal aug else agreement terminated highly politicized climate california energy crisis unfolded imperative understand agendas stakeholder possesses instance keep mind gov davis political career severely damaged state energy crisis fact pacific gas electric co california largest utility company declared bankruptcy tainted governor standing perhaps goal davis wants keep sce also filing chapter protection addition davis believes better able solve crisis assumes control state transmission grid much like state assumed role power purchasing agent normally measure supported democratic governor could easily approved california democrat controlled legislature however energy issue divided support davis even within party consequently governor needs support republicans democrats order see rescue plan sce pass part little reason sce agreed governor terms multiple standpoints utility gains enormously governor offer time avoids lengthy costly bankruptcy proceedings agreement sce gains method pulling debt via rate increases probably would implemented next years parent company edison international gets hold reported billion sce provided corporate operation since exception million tax refund edison international would give back sce davis referred plan good balanced deal consumer groups charged sce taken governor cleaners meanwhile california customers clearly lose deal would forced ultimately pay billion state needs buy transmission assets state would purchase lines bonds would paid transmission fees charged sce customers presently clear whether fees already part monthly bills would sufficient therefore likely rates would increased support purchase addition subtext deal customers would ultimately pay drive sce debt accumulated result unrestricted wholesale power costs charged generators consequently california customers would bear responsibility prices ferc times deemed unjust unreasonable ultimately however california legislature cpuc authority approve agreement gov davis sce two agencies must ultimately decide plan good bad weigh impact various stakeholders presently legislature particular finding many questionable aspects plan instance value would california government owning one portion state interconnected transmission system pgocorp walked away negotiating table expressed little interest selling transmission lines state agreement sempra energy parent san diego gas electric reached either thus gov davis sce agreement approved state california would gain ownership rights portion overall transmission system state many legislators challenge value especially considered congestion leads higher prices within state concentrated along pg e portion grid counter argument point utility bankruptcy proceedings pgomay choice whether sell transmission assets state bankruptcy judge would make decision thus argue state may better chance obtaining pg e transmission assets first complete deal sce second fundamental problem causing california legislators turn back governor plan referred obscene bailout sce parent company reportedly believe gov davis rushed overly generous offer sce anxiety caused breakdown communications pg e noted billion offer sce assets times book value many legislators difficulty reconciling appears inappropriate price tag cost taxpayers ratepayers would ultimately absorb currently sce customers pay ferc approved transmission rate based upon cost plus formula state pays times book value would equate ratepayers paying two times transmission lines addition legislators including former democratic allies gov davis suggested sce forced enter bankruptcy pacific gas electric co done naturally legislators approach issue constituents mind knowing accountable vote plan looking issue customer perspective one could argue sce declaring bankruptcy would create less financial hardship california customers bailing utility increasing rates major political challenge california legislators resolve governor plan becomes sponsored bill pull crystal ball bold make projections case would predict little chance gov davis rescue plan sce pass current form energy crisis california become politicized legislators reticent approve measure resembles financial bailout one utilities especially without obtaining something value state return gov davis personal agenda obtain control state transmission assets see priority california lawmakers thus deal tough sell unless new development occurs puts owning sce transmission assets state best interest
