higher prices consumers businesses shortage going get worse summer typical weather conditions state could face much percent shortfall electric power summer peak demand mean severe emergency conditions periods blackouts effect likely big shock economy california rest interconnected west also bruised national economy unlike states successfully deregulated past years california made three crucial mistakes since mid restructuring power industry began first political unwillingness allow consumers see real price signals called wholesale price utilities pay generating companies decontrolled price consumers pay utilities consumer prices remain levels gov gray davis promised hold pledge rate increase although price natural gas used make large rapidly growing share electricity california increased dramatically consumers would know bills would know rain snowfall levels california critically depends hydropower low levels result utilities perverse position selling power customers much lower rates buying power generators utilities billion hole teetering bankruptcy instead letting customers see higher prices reflect realities supply demand act accordingly state going use tax money

prevented electric power rates going california drains electricity neighbors residents states seeing power bills go percent calculate rates california rose percent third shortage could disappear matter months instead state embarked course passing higher costs along consumers neighboring states leaving major bill paid californians decades come second mistake california failure charge customers capacity electricity unlike commodities cannot stored shortage telephone equipment result busy signal frustrating survivable comes electric power equivalent busy signal blackout unacceptable thus well functioning power system needs pay generators maintain adequate capacity includes reserve capacity percent expected demand cope unexpected whether heat wave sudden surge economic growth breakdowns aging power plants contrast states california scheme provide incentive generating companies add new capacity maintain kind reserve third mistake creation monumental obstacles siting granting permits new facilities california one difficult places earth build new power plant environmental permit process contrast states complex cumbersome deeply discouraging would investors companies spend three four years get approval approval find proposal shot yet another local group result major new plants built state past years meanwhile california economy grew percent past five years time electricity

analysis sudden change president bush position co emissions  naturally elicited strong reactions sides debate  extent co contributes nation pollution whether n ot government take active role restricting co emissions  become intensely politicized issue democrats environmental groups  responded outrage perceive betrayal president  coal oil industry officials believe bush decision ensure balanced energy environmental policy attempt debate political aspects president decision  rather analyze bush current position impacts energy industry  whether lifting co restrictions indeed contribute  sound energy policy true campaign president made promises limit c  emissions speech late september bush said help congress environmental groups industry require power plan ts meet clean air standards order reduce emissions sulfur dioxide  nitrogen oxide mercury carbon dioxide within reasonable period time yet many critics claimed bush refusal place limits co philosophical turnabout white house spokesman scott mcclellan said carbon dioxide included pollutant bush campaign position classified one  clean air act white house said bush original  promise mistake inconsistent president
