Reply a . s . a . p  united trust bank limited  80 haymarket , london  swly 4 te  i am mr . alexander george , the account officer of mr . morris  thompson who died in the plane crash of alaska airlines  flight 261 which crashed on january 31 2000 along with his  wife and only daughter ( who happens to be his next of kin ) .  he has an account with us . you should read more about the  crash on visiting this site ( s ) .  since we got information about his death , we have been  expecting his next of kin or relatives to come over and  claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody  applies for it as next of kin or as a relative to the  deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines .  i was contacted by the executor of his will to find somebody  that can stand in as his next of kin , so that the funds  would not be trapped in our bank . all legal paper work will  be taken care of by him ( the executor )  if you are favorably disposed to joing us in doing this ,  please respond as soon as possible . in the event you are not  interested , i sincerely ask that you disregard this email  and tell no one about it . i am very careful on truncating my  banking career should you mention this to someoneelse . i  hope you can be trusted in this regard .  regards ,  alexander george
