Investment / partnership proposal  dear sir ,  i am mr . femi olugbade , a bank executive . i am sending this  message to you in confidence . i am asking for your favor in  the transfer of some money belonging to one mr barry kelly  ( deceased ) whose death we were not aware of until we no longer  got reply to our routine notifications to his forwarding  address . we were however told by his employers , that he died  from an automobile crash . now all attempts to trace his next  of kin has proved abortive . there is however no trace in any  of his official documents of a next of kin .  the basic line here is that at the expiration of 6 years , the  money will revert to the ownership of the  government . nobody is ever coming to claim this money having  spent 5 and a half years in our bank .  so all i am asking from you is that you should stand in as his  next of kin to avoid the money going into the hands of corrupt  government officials . also note that , it is impossible for the  money to leave the coffers of the bank without a next of kin ,  who also must be a foreigner .  further workings of this initiative , and a sharing ratio , plus  possible areas of investment will be  discussed as soon as i hear from you .  best regards .  femi olugbade
